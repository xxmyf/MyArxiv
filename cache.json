To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding.

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS. Practically, by providing early\ndetection and explaining the critical factors, DKDD can supplement clinical\ndepression screening and enable large-scale evaluations of a population's\nmental health status.\n","authors":["Wenli Zhang","Jiaheng Xie","Xiang Liu","Zhu Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05389v1.pdf","comment":"Presented at INFORMS 2022 Data Science Workshop"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05382v1","updated":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","published":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","title":"ChatGPT is on the horizon: Could a large language model be all we need\n  for Intelligent Transportation?","summary":"  ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models\n(LLM) with over 175 billion parameters.

However, NSI and\nORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background,\nand large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated\nmethod is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay\nsufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the\nfinal saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose\na novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware\nAuxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary\nProtection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge\nposition information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level\nfeatures.

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs. In addition,\nexisting literature on modeling non-uniformity either assume user interests are\nindependent of the products, or lack theoretical understanding. In this paper,\nwe first model the user-product preferences as a partially observed matrix with\nnon-uniform observation pattern. Next, building on the literature about\nlow-rank matrix estimation, we introduce a new weighted trace-norm penalized\nregression to predict unobserved values of the matrix. We then prove an upper\nbound for the prediction error of our proposed approach. Our upper bound is a\nfunction of a number of parameters that are based on a certain weight matrix\nthat depends on the joint distribution of users and products.

However, segmenting or auto-localizing all fingerprints in a slap\nimage is a challenging task due to the different orientations of fingerprints,\nnoisy backgrounds, and the smaller size of fingertip components. The presence\nof slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are\nrotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and\nlabel the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and\nfinger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep\nlearning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from\nboth axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images. We built a fingerprint\nsegmentation model named CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation\nModel) by updating the previously proposed CFSEG model which was based on\ntraditional Faster R-CNN architecture [21]. CRFSEG improves upon the Faster\nR-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to\nperform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm\non a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children\nsubjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across\ndifferent age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully. In\nthe Combined dataset containing both normal and rotated images of adult and\nchildren subjects, we achieved a matching accuracy of 97.17%, which\noutperformed state-of-the-art VeriFinger (94.25%) and NFSEG segmentation\nsystems (80.58%).\n","authors":["M.

In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision\nsetting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise\n$\\delta$, as a $\\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\\delta$-MDP). Based\non the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\\delta$-MDP and propose two\nnovel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for\nattacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate\nuniversal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q\nfunction. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a\nsignificant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with\ndifferent datasets and different scenes. Extensive experimental results\nindicate that there exist serious potential risks for applying Embodied Vision\nNavigation methods to the real world.\n","authors":["Chengyang Ying","You Qiaoben","Xinning Zhou","Hang Su","Wenbo Ding","Jianyong Ai"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05751v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03041v1","updated":"2023-03-06T11:13:23Z","published":"2023-03-06T11:13:23Z","title":"Automatic detection of aerial survey ground control points based on\n  Yolov5-OBB","summary":"  The use of ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing is the most common\nstrategy in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, but at the same time\ntheir collection represents the most time-consuming and expensive part of UAV\ncampaigns.

However,\noverlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be\nseparated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple\nclasses with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging\nbecause normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper\npresents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,\nspecifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing\non overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates\nellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then\nfinds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood\nsmear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.\nHowever, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was\n34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples.

Therefore accurate AU recognition unlocks unbiaised face\nrepresentation which can improve face-based affective computing applications.\nFrom a learning standpoint AU detection is a multi-task problem with strong\ninter-task dependencies. To solve such problem, most approaches either rely on\nweight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the joint\ntask distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields\ncomprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an\narbitrary order into an unordered task set. Crucially, this ordering choice has\nbeen identified as a source of performance variations. In this paper, we\npresent Multi-Order Network (MONET), a multi-task method with joint task order\noptimization. MONET uses a differentiable order selection to jointly learn\ntask-wise modules with their optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce\nwarmup and order dropout to enhance order selection by encouraging order\nexploration.

Conventional methods\nsuffer from the trade-off between consistency and fine-grained details due to\nthe local-receptive field limiting their practicality. This lack of long-range\ndependency inherently comes from the convolutional neural network part of the\narchitecture. In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely\nDwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for\nend-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware\nfeatures while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of\nlocal and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and\nlong-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally\nexpensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,\nDwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such\nas translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.\nFurthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which\nmay result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing\nencoder and decoder features. In contrast, the Dwin-CAT employs both local and\nglobal window cross-attention to seamlessly fuse encoder and decoder features\nwith both fine-grained local and contextually aware global information,\neffectively amending semantic gap.

However, these methods require pixel-wise ground-truth labels, which can\nbe time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised\nframework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel\nground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence\nof images and comprises two networks.

During the test phase, the input images are\nprocessed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic\nbackground images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove\ndynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a\nforeground image that is free of dynamic artifacts.

Artificial neural networks come nowhere close: when\ntasked with learning to classify objects by training on non-repeating video\nframes in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from\nshuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new\nstimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, Compositional Replay\nUsing Memory Blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature\nmaps reconstructed by recombining generic parts. Just as crumbs together form a\nloaf of bread, we concatenate trainable and re-usable \"memory block\" vectors to\ncompositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural\nnetworks. CRUMB stores the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new\nstimuli, enabling replay of specific memories during later tasks.

In this paper, we propose masked video distillation\n(MVD), a simple yet effective two-stage masked feature modeling framework for\nvideo representation learning: firstly we pretrain an image (or video) model by\nrecovering low-level features of masked patches, then we use the resulting\nfeatures as targets for masked feature modeling. For the choice of teacher\nmodels, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on\ntemporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial\nrepresentations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also\nindicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students.\nMotivated by this observation, we design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method\nfor MVD.

Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that video transformers pretrained with spatial-temporal\nco-teaching outperform models distilled with a single teacher on a multitude of\nvideo datasets.

In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach for the multi-agent efficient domain coverage problem involving agents\nwith second-order dynamics. Our approach is based on the Multi-Agent Proximal\nPolicy Optimization Algorithm (MAPPO). Our proposed network architecture\nincludes the incorporation of LSTM and self-attention, which allows the trained\npolicy to adapt to a variable number of agents. Our trained policy\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art classical control policy.

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x.

If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper.

By opti-mizing CNN hyperparameters with LDWPSO,\nlearning the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we compare the accuracy with a\nstandard CNN based on LeNet-5. As a result, when using the MNIST dataset, the\nbaseline CNN is 94.02% at the 5th epoch, compared to 98.95% for LDWPSO CNN,\nwhich improves accuracy. When using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the Baseline CNN is\n28.07% at the 10th epoch, compared to 69.37% for the LDWPSO CNN, which greatly\nimproves accuracy.

On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space.

To provide empirical\nvalidation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three\nmodern baselines -- arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping --\nusing GPT-2 and WaveRNN as communication channels. We find that the minimum\nentropy coupling-based approach yields superior encoding efficiency, despite\nits stronger security constraints.

However, modern\nmultimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it\nchallenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the\ninternal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to\nfill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of\nmultimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages:\n(1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream\nmodeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities\nrelate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and\ncross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4)\nmultimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a\nprediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models,\ntasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6\nreal-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together\nenable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable\nconcepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications,\nand (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models.

We investigate two setups-ICL with\nflipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model\nfamilies (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments\non ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent\nability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels\npresented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from\npretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with\nin-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic\npriors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label\nICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs\n(e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models\nto learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to\nperform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale,\nand large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a\nSUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that\ninstruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity\nto learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.\n","authors":["Jerry Wei","Jason Wei","Yi Tay","Dustin Tran","Albert Webson","Yifeng Lu","Xinyun Chen","Hanxiao Liu","Da Huang","Denny Zhou","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03846v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13149v2","updated":"2023-03-07T12:22:00Z","published":"2023-02-25T20:24:58Z","title":"STACC: Code Comment Classification using SentenceTransformers","summary":"  Code comments are a key resource for information about software artefacts.\nDepending on the use case, only some types of comments are useful.

The\nso-called universal quantum computing model (UQCM), e.g., the circuit model,\nhas been the main framework to guide the design of quantum algorithms, creation\nof real quantum computers etc. In this work, we combine the study of UQCM\ntogether with QRT.

If prosody transfer methods do indeed\ntransfer prosody they should be able to be trained in the way we propose.\nHowever, results show that a model trained under these conditions performs\nsignificantly worse than one trained using the target utterance as a reference.\nTo explain this, we hypothesize that prosody transfer models do not learn a\ntransferable representation of prosody, but rather an utterance-level\nrepresentation which is highly dependent on both the reference speaker and\nreference text.\n","authors":["Atli Thor Sigurgeirsson","Simon King"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04289v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted in ICASSP 2023, 5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09697v5","updated":"2023-03-07T23:09:55Z","published":"2020-10-19T17:40:38Z","title":"Effects of Parameter Norm Growth During Transformer Training: Inductive\n  Bias from Gradient Descent","summary":"  The capacity of neural networks like the widely adopted transformer is known\nto be very high.

Besides other criticisms, like\ncreating filter bubbles within social networks, recommender systems are often\nreproved for collecting considerable amounts of personal data. However, to\npersonalize recommendations, personal information is fundamentally required. A\nrecent distributed learning scheme called federated learning has made it\npossible to learn from personal user data without its central collection.\nAccordingly, we present a complete recommender system for movie\nrecommendations, which provides privacy and thus trustworthiness on two levels:\nFirst, it is trained using federated learning and thus is, by its very nature,\nprivacy-preserving, while still enabling individual users to benefit from\nglobal insights. And second, a novel federated learning scheme, FedQ, is\nemployed, which not only addresses the problem of non-i.i.d. and small local\ndatasets, but also prevents input data reconstruction attacks by aggregating\nclient models early. To reduce the communication overhead, compression is\napplied, which significantly reduces the exchanged neural network updates to a\nfraction of their original data.

In this paper, we resort to cloud\nrendering and present NEPHELE, a neural platform for highly realistic cloud\nradiance rendering.

Fortunately,\ncontrastive multimodal models have been shown to be highly effective at\naligning entities in images/videos and text, e.g., CLIP; text contrastive\nmodels have been extensively studied recently for their strong ability of\nproducing discriminative sentence embeddings, e.g., SimCSE. Their abilities are\nexactly needed by multi-channel video-language retrieval. However, there is not\na clear way to quickly adapt these two lines to multi-channel video-language\nretrieval with limited data and resources. In this paper, we identify a\nprincipled model design space with two axes: how to represent videos and how to\nfuse video and text information. Based on categorization of recent methods, we\ninvestigate the options of representing videos using continuous feature vectors\nor discrete text tokens; for the fusion method, we explore the use of a\nmultimodal transformer or a pretrained contrastive text model. We extensively\nevaluate the four combinations on five video-language datasets. We surprisingly\nfind that discrete text tokens coupled with a pretrained contrastive text model\nyields the best performance, which can even outperform state-of-the-art on the\niVQA and How2QA datasets without the additional training on millions of\nvideo-language data. Further analysis shows that this is because representing\nvideos as text tokens captures the key visual information with text tokens that\nare naturally aligned with text models and the text models are strong\nmultimodal retriever after the contrastive pretraining process.\n","authors":["Xudong Lin","Simran Tiwari","Shiyuan Huang","Manling Li","Mike Zheng Shou","Heng Ji","Shih-Fu Chang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02082v3.pdf","comment":"To appear in CVPR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10768v2","updated":"2023-03-07T15:11:10Z","published":"2023-01-19T11:11:57Z","title":"On the Importance of Sign Labeling: The Hamburg Sign Language Notation\n  System Case Study","summary":"  Labeling is the cornerstone of supervised machine learning, which has been\nexploited in a plethora of various applications, with sign language recognition\nbeing one of them.

However, the spin is challenging to measure because\nof the ball's high velocity and the magnitude of the spin values. Existing\nmethods either require extremely high framerate cameras or are unreliable\nbecause they use the ball's logo, which may not always be visible. Because of\nthis, many table tennis-playing robots ignore the spin, which severely limits\ntheir capabilities. This paper proposes an easily implementable and reliable\nspin estimation method. We developed a dotted-ball orientation estimation (DOE)\nmethod, that can then be used to estimate the spin. The dots are first\nlocalized on the image using a CNN and then identified using geometric hashing.\nThe spin is finally regressed from the estimated orientations. Using our\nalgorithm, the ball's orientation can be estimated with a mean error of\n2.4{\\deg} and the spin estimation has an relative error lower than 1%. Spins up\nto 175 rps are measurable with a camera of 350 fps in real time.

However, it still remains\nchallenging to craft targeted adversarial examples with higher transferability\nthan non-targeted ones. Recent studies reveal that the traditional\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted\nadversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we\nprovide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the\nlogit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain\nsaturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this\npaper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along\nthe optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and\neffective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the\nlogits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively. Both of\nthem can effectively encourage optimization to produce a larger logit margin\nand lead to higher transferability.

It is thus important to propose\neffective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the\nsafety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit\npoor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a\nnovel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by\nhandling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The\nproposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the\nimportance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and \"noise\"\nchannels. Then, the propagation of \"noise\" channels is suppressed in the\nfeature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is\ndesigned to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution\nof live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more\ndisperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that\nthe proposed CFD-PAD can achieve a 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and\na 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0%\n(TDR@FDR=1%).

In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely\nDwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for\nend-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware\nfeatures while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of\nlocal and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and\nlong-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally\nexpensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,\nDwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such\nas translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.\nFurthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which\nmay result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing\nencoder and decoder features.

Different\nfrom dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout\noperations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the\ndropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically\nverify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features\nof attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns\nand enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to\nschedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a\nconstant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that\ngradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We\nexperimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in\nlow-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the\nrobustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform\nstructured dropout operation as CNN?

It first disentangles\nthe content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are\nthen recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this\nway, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,\nand simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different\nattributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face\ngeometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with\nlatent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier\nDisentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents\nidentifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative\ndescriptions.

Besides, there can be images with\nrare characteristics that make it difficult to find similar example images,\nwhich we call isolated samples. Here, we introduce a novel sketch-based medical\nimage retrieval (SBMIR) system that enables users to find images of interest\nwithout example images. The key idea lies in feature decomposition of medical\nimages, whereby the entire feature of a medical image can be decomposed into\nand reconstructed from normal and abnormal features. By extending this idea,\nour SBMIR system provides an easy-to-use two-step graphical user interface:\nusers first select a template image to specify a normal feature and then draw a\nsemantic sketch of the disease on the template image to represent an abnormal\nfeature. Subsequently, it integrates the two kinds of input to construct a\nquery vector and retrieves reference images with the closest reference vectors.\nUsing two datasets, ten healthcare professionals with various clinical\nbackgrounds participated in the user test for evaluation. As a result, our\nSBMIR system enabled users to overcome previous challenges, including image\nretrieval based on fine-grained image characteristics, image retrieval without\nexample images, and image retrieval for isolated samples.

Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel\nimplicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth\nembedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the\nembedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any\ngoal-image specified downstream task.

This potentially unauthorized usage of\nonline data leads to concerns regarding data privacy. Recent works aim to make\nunlearnable data for deep learning models by adding small, specially designed\nnoises to tackle this issue. However, these methods are vulnerable to\nadversarial training (AT) and/or are computationally heavy. In this work, we\npropose a novel, model-free, Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA)\ngeneration technique. CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise\nconvolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key. CUDA\nencourages the network to learn the relation between filters and labels rather\nthan informative features for classifying the clean data. We develop some\ntheoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian\nmixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes\nclassifier. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA with\nvarious datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), and\narchitectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16, Wide ResNet-34-10, DenseNet-121, DeIT,\nEfficientNetV2-S, and MobileNetV2). Our experiments show that CUDA is robust to\nvarious data augmentations and training approaches such as smoothing, AT with\ndifferent budgets, transfer learning, and fine-tuning.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ngraph-based approach, SKGHOI (Spatial-Semantic Knowledge Graph for Human-Object\nInteraction Detection), that effectively captures the sentiment representation\nof HOIs by integrating both spatial and semantic knowledge.

Most previous\napproaches have opted to learn a single representation of query images, which\nare then classified at different levels of geographic granularity. These\napproaches fail to exploit the different visual cues that give context to\ndifferent hierarchies, such as the country, state, and city level. To this end,\nwe introduce an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that exploits the\nrelationship between different geographic levels (which we refer to as\nhierarchies) and the corresponding visual scene information in an image through\nhierarchical cross-attention. We achieve this by learning a query for each\ngeographic hierarchy and scene type.

This paper proposes a\nnovel and end-to-end integrated framework for high resolution and attribute\npreservation face swapping via Adaptive Latent Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-task dual-space face encoder by sharing\nthe underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial\nregion perception and face encoding. This encoder enables us to control the\nface pose and attribute individually, thus enhancing the face swapping quality.\nNext, we propose an adaptive latent codes swapping module to adaptively learn\nthe mapping between the facial attributes and the latent codes and select\neffective latent codes for improved retention of facial attributes. Finally,\nthe initial face swapping image generated by StyleGAN2 is blended with the\nfacial region mask generated by our encoder to address the background blur\nproblem.

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

Additionally, the FIFK's incorporation\nof probabilistic principles can further enhance the accuracy and effectiveness\nof solutions. In cases of noisy operator equations and limited data, the FIFK's\nflexibility in defining problems using prior information or cross-validation\nwith various kernel designs is especially advantageous. This capability allows\nfor detailed problem definitions and facilitates achieving high levels of\naccuracy and stability in solutions. In our study, we examined the FIFK through\ntwo different approaches. Firstly, we implemented a semi-supervised assumption\nby using the same Fredholm operator kernel and data function kernel and\nincorporating unlabeled information. Secondly, we used the MSDF method, which\ninvolves selecting different kernels on both sides of the equation to define\nwhen the mapping kernel is different from the data function kernel. To assess\nthe effectiveness of the FIFK and the proposed methods in solving ill-posed\nproblems, we conducted experiments on a real-world dataset. Our goal was to\ncompare the performance of these methods against the widely used least-squares\nmethod and other comparable methods.\n","authors":["Amir Khanjari","Saeid Pourmand","Mohammad Reza Faridrohani"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03894v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03876v1","updated":"2023-03-07T13:23:31Z","published":"2023-03-07T13:23:31Z","title":"Organelle-specific segmentation, spatial analysis, and visualization of\n  volume electron microscopy datasets","summary":"  Volume electron microscopy is the method of choice for the in-situ\ninterrogation of cellular ultrastructure at the nanometer scale.

Prior work\nindicates that DP has negative implications on model accuracy and fairness,\nwhich are unacceptable in medicine and represent a main barrier to the\nwidespread use of privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we evaluated the\neffect of privacy-preserving training of AI models for chest radiograph\ndiagnosis regarding accuracy and fairness compared to non-private training. For\nthis, we used a large dataset (N=193,311) of high quality clinical chest\nradiographs, which were retrospectively collected and manually labeled by\nexperienced radiologists. We then compared non-private deep convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and privacy-preserving (DP) models with respect to\nprivacy-utility trade-offs measured as area under the\nreceiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUROC), and privacy-fairness\ntrade-offs, measured as Pearson's r or Statistical Parity Difference. We found\nthat the non-private CNNs achieved an average AUROC score of 0.90 +- 0.04 over\nall labels, whereas the DP CNNs with a privacy budget of epsilon=7.89 resulted\nin an AUROC of 0.87 +- 0.04, i.e., a mere 2.6% performance decrease compared to\nnon-private training. Furthermore, we found the privacy-preserving training not\nto amplify discrimination against age, sex or co-morbidity. Our study shows\nthat -- under the challenging realistic circumstances of a real-life clinical\ndataset -- the privacy-preserving training of diagnostic deep learning models\nis possible with excellent diagnostic accuracy and fairness.\n","authors":["Soroosh Tayebi Arasteh","Alexander Ziller","Christiane Kuhl","Marcus Makowski","Sven Nebelung","Rickmer Braren","Daniel Rueckert","Daniel Truhn","Georgios Kaissis"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.01622v2.pdf","comment":"3 tables, 5 figures, 11 supplementary materials"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03761v1","updated":"2023-03-07T09:56:23Z","published":"2023-03-07T09:56:23Z","title":"Graph Neural Networks in Vision-Language Image Understanding: A Survey","summary":"  2D image understanding is a complex problem within Computer Vision, but it\nholds the key to providing human level scene comprehension.

To understand how these two perspectives affect\noverall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we conduct a large-scale subjective\nstudy to collect human quality opinions on overall quality of videos as well as\nperceptions from aesthetic and technical perspectives.

This papers develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is,\nwe model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain.\nBesides the quest for generating images at ever higher resolution our primary\nmotivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem so\nthat we can discretize it consistently on multiple resolution levels. We\nthereby hope to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different\nresolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We\ndemonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the\ninfinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process to ensure\nthat the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional\nsetting using the notion of trace class operators. Second, we illustrate that\napproximating the score function with an operator network, in our case Fourier\nneural operators (FNOs), is beneficial for multilevel training.

Specially, the model which incorporates\nour CGF with ACVNet ranks $1^{st}$ on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards\namong all the published methods. We further propose an informative and concise\ncost volume, named Attention Feature Volume (AFV), which exploits a correlation\nvolume as attention weights to filter a feature volume. Based on CGF and AFV,\nthe proposed CGI-Stereo outperforms all other published real-time methods on\nKITTI benchmarks and shows better generalization ability than other real-time\nmethods.

This enables capturing visual information at fine time\ngranularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes\nevent cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid\nmotion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However,\nconvolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently\nperform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate -\ncurrent CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the\nframe rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera\nrates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal\nresolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach\nto enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that\nconsecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences\nbetween them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between\nconsecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant\nreduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the\ninference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to\nleverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain\nthe sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network.

In this work, we adopt metamorphic testing\nto evaluate the robustness of HPE models and provide suggestions on the choice\nof HPE models for different applications. The robustness evaluation was\nconducted on four state-of-the-art models, namely MediaPipe hands, OpenPose,\nBodyHands, and NSRM hand. We found that on average more than 80\\% of the hands\ncould not be identified by BodyHands, and at least 50\\% of hands could not be\nidentified by MediaPipe hands when diagonal motion blur is introduced, while an\naverage of more than 50\\% of strongly underexposed hands could not be correctly\nestimated by NSRM hand. Similarly, applying occlusions on only four hand joints\nwill also largely degrade the performance of these models.

Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain under the\nassumption that the target domain contains unknown classes. Existing OSDA\nmethods consistently lay stress on the covariate shift, ignoring the potential\nlabel shift problem. The performance of OSDA methods degrades drastically under\nintra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. However, little\nattention has been paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, the\nImbalanced Open Set Domain Adaptation (IOSDA) is explored where the covariate\nshift, label shift and category mismatch exist simultaneously. To alleviate the\nnegative effects raised by label shift in OSDA, we propose Open-set\nMoving-threshold Estimation and Gradual Alignment (OMEGA) - a novel\narchitecture that improves existing OSDA methods on class-imbalanced data.\nSpecifically, a novel unknown-aware target clustering scheme is proposed to\nform tight clusters in the target domain to reduce the negative effects of\nlabel shift and intra-domain class imbalance.

In recent works, two approaches\nfor UVOS have been discussed that can be divided into: appearance and\nappearance-motion based methods. Appearance based methods utilize the\ncorrelation information of inter-frames to capture target object that commonly\nappears in a sequence. However, these methods does not consider the motion of\ntarget object due to exploit the correlation information between randomly\npaired frames.

To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained\nrepresentation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and\nlocal perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature\nresolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the\nsemantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information\naggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature\nalignment aggregation. It generates semantic flow among feature maps from\ndifferent resolutions to transform their pixel positions.

Multiple parallel branches of\nMPMG allow it to focus on different parts of targets to generate local masks\nwithout label supervision.

Unlike\nexisting DLCs, RAF accepts a forward model and in-house generates a training\ngraph. Accordingly, RAF is able to systematically consolidate graph\noptimizations for performance, memory and distributed training. In addition, to\ncatch up to the state-of-the-art performance with hand-crafted kernel libraries\nas well as tensor compilers, RAF proposes an operator dialect mechanism to\nseamlessly integrate all possible kernel implementations.

A\nmajor limitation of current probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is\ntheir restriction to finite probability distributions, i.e., discrete random\nvariables. In contrast, deep probabilistic programming (DPP) excels in\nmodelling and optimising continuous probability distributions. Hence, we\nintroduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language\nthat incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of\ninference and learning of both discrete and continuous probability\ndistributions under logical constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the\nsemantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a\nproven asymptotically unbiased learning algorithm, and 3) a series of\nexperiments that illustrate the versatility of our approach.\n","authors":["Lennert De Smet","Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires","Robin Manhaeve","Giuseppe Marra","Angelika Kimmig","Luc De Readt"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04660v1.pdf","comment":"27 pages, 9 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12992v2","updated":"2023-03-08T15:25:18Z","published":"2021-08-30T05:07:59Z","title":"SHIFT15M: Fashion-specific dataset for set-to-set matching with several\n  distribution shifts","summary":"  This paper addresses the problem of set-to-set matching, which involves\nmatching two different sets of items based on some criteria, especially in the\ncase of high-dimensional items like images.

The intensity of the pandemic on a\ngiven territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying\nthe rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time\nevolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem\nformulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization.

VLMaps\ncan be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration\napproaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional\nlabeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs),\nVLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence\nof open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial\nby construction, e.g., \"in between the sofa and TV\" or \"three meters to the\nright of the chair\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared\namong multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps\non-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories). Extensive experiments\ncarried out in simulated and real world environments show that VLMaps enable\nnavigation according to more complex language instructions than existing\nmethods.

Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional.

First, we explore the theory behind the\ngeneralization of hybrid models from the Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)\nperspective. A consequence of our PAC guarantee is the existence of a sweet\nspot for the optimal transparency of the system.

In this paper, we show that if\nwe cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its\nlearning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its\ngradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the\ncorresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically\ncharacterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features\nwith the alignment update and the uniformity update.

This connection\nnot only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently\ndeveloped in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from\nMP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention,\ngraph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message\npassing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of\ncontrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent\nareas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from\neach other.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries.

Although successful on\nprevious missions, this approach is restricted to the specificity of the\ntemplates and limited by the fidelity of the underlying hazard map, which both\nrequire extensive pre-flight cost and effort to obtain and develop. Terrestrial\nsystems that perform a similar task in applications such as autonomous driving\nutilize state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to successfully localize and\nclassify navigation hazards. Advancements in spacecraft co-processors aimed at\naccelerating deep learning inference enable the application of these methods in\nspace for the first time. In this work, we introduce You Only Crash Once\n(YOCO), a deep learning-based visual hazardous terrain detection and\nclassification technique for autonomous spacecraft planetary landings. Through\nthe use of unsupervised domain adaptation we tailor YOCO for training by\nsimulation, removing the need for real-world annotated data and expensive\nmission surveying phases. We further improve the transfer of representative\nterrain knowledge between simulation and the real world through visual\nsimilarity clustering. We demonstrate the utility of YOCO through a series of\nterrestrial and extraterrestrial simulation-to-real experiments and show\nsubstantial improvements toward the ability to both detect and accurately\nclassify instances of planetary terrain.\n","authors":["Timothy Chase Jr","Chris Gnam","John Crassidis","Karthik Dantu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04891v1.pdf","comment":"To be published in proceedings of AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist\n  Conference 2022"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10609v2","updated":"2023-03-08T21:10:38Z","published":"2022-08-22T21:30:55Z","title":"Global Concept-Based Interpretability for Graph Neural Networks via\n  Neuron Analysis","summary":"  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective on a variety of\ngraph-related tasks; however, they lack interpretability and transparency.\nCurrent explainability approaches are typically local and treat GNNs as\nblack-boxes.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the impact of\ndifferent choices of linear and nonlinear architectures on the implicit bias of\nthe learned features and the adversarial perturbations, in both spatial and\nfrequency domains. We find that the high-frequency adversarial perturbations\nare critically dependent on the convolution operation because the\nspatially-limited nature of local convolutions induces an implicit bias towards\nhigh frequency features.

With DALL-E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new\nstandard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a\nfundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like\nLAION? We find that na\\\"Ively increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN\narchitecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN\narchitecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option\nfor text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it\nis orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to\nsynthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for\nexample, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds. Finally, GigaGAN supports various\nlatent space editing applications such as latent interpolation, style mixing,\nand vector arithmetic operations.\n","authors":["Minguk Kang","Jun-Yan Zhu","Richard Zhang","Jaesik Park","Eli Shechtman","Sylvain Paris","Taesung Park"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05511v1.pdf","comment":"CVPR 2023.

However,\nwhen deployed in the open world, they exhibit notable bias towards seen classes\nand suffer from significant performance drop. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach for open world instance segmentation called bottom-Up and top-Down\nOpen-world Segmentation (UDOS) that combines classical bottom-up segmentation\nalgorithms within a top-down learning framework. UDOS first predicts parts of\nobjects using a top-down network trained with weak supervision from bottom-up\nsegmentations. The bottom-up segmentations are class-agnostic and do not\noverfit to specific taxonomies. The part-masks are then fed into affinity-based\ngrouping and refinement modules to predict robust instance-level segmentations.\nUDOS enjoys both the speed and efficiency from the top-down architectures and\nthe generalization ability to unseen categories from bottom-up supervision. We\nvalidate the strengths of UDOS on multiple cross-category as well as\ncross-dataset transfer tasks from 5 challenging datasets including MS-COCO,\nLVIS, ADE20k, UVO and OpenImages, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art across the board.

However,\nvideo anomaly detection is particularly context-specific, and the availability\nof representative datasets heavily limits real-world accuracy. Additionally,\nthe metrics currently reported by most state-of-the-art methods often do not\nreflect how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios. In this\narticle, we present the Charlotte Anomaly Dataset (CHAD). CHAD is a\nhigh-resolution, multi-camera anomaly dataset in a commercial parking lot\nsetting. In addition to frame-level anomaly labels, CHAD is the first anomaly\ndataset to include bounding box, identity, and pose annotations for each actor.\nThis is especially beneficial for skeleton-based anomaly detection, which is\nuseful for its lower computational demand in real-world settings.

However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB\nsignals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for\nthe encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long\npre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the\npixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from\npre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning.\nDifferent from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked\nAutoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level\nrepresentations without interference during pre-training. For high-level\nsemantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder\nto capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level\nstructures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel\nvalues for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level\nand low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning\nconflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior\nvisual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE\nbase pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after\nfine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous\nstate-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%.

This common assumption may\nnot be met in practical applications, since the sensitive nature of medical\nimages may ultimately require their analysis under privacy constraints,\npreventing to openly share the image content.In this work, we formulate the\nproblem of image registration under a privacy preserving regime, where images\nare assumed to be confidential and cannot be disclosed in clear. We derive our\nprivacy preserving image registration framework by extending classical\nregistration paradigms to account for advanced cryptographic tools, such as\nsecure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption, that enable the\nexecution of operations without leaking the underlying data.

If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the\ncalibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would\nbe different. In other words, a calibrator optimal on the calibration set would\nbe suboptimal on the OOD test set and thus has degraded performance. With this\nknowledge, we propose a simple and effective method named adaptive calibrator\nensemble (ACE) to calibrate OOD datasets whose difficulty is usually higher\nthan the calibration set. Specifically, two calibration functions are trained,\none for in-distribution data (low difficulty), and the other for severely OOD\ndata (high difficulty).

Plenty of methods have\nbeen proposed for automatic brain tumor segmentation using four common MRI\nmodalities and achieved remarkable performance. In practice, however, it is\ncommon to have one or more modalities missing due to image corruption,\nartifacts, acquisition protocols, allergy to contrast agents, or simply cost.\nIn this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for brain tumor\nsegmentation with missing modalities. In the first stage, a multimodal masked\nautoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality\ndropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a\nreconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal\nrepresentations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework\nM3AE. Meanwhile, we employ model inversion to optimize a representative\nfull-modal image at marginal extra cost, which will be used to substitute for\nthe missing modalities and boost performance during inference. Then in the\nsecond stage, a memory-efficient self distillation is proposed to distill\nknowledge between heterogenous missing-modal situations while fine-tuning the\nmodel for supervised segmentation. Our M3AE belongs to the 'catch-all' genre\nwhere a single model can be applied to all possible subsets of modalities, thus\nis economic for both training and deployment.

In\nparticular, cells are cultured under different conditions depending on the\npurpose of the research.

In the prediction result for the target domain, even if the\npeak location is correct, the signal distribution around the peak often has a\nnon-Gaussian shape. The pseudo-cell-position heatmap is thus re-generated using\nthe peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear Gaussian shape.

Recent volumetric methods learn to directly\npredict the TSDF volume and have demonstrated promising results in this task.\nHowever, most methods focus on how to extract and fuse the 2D features to a 3D\nfeature volume, but none of them improve the way how the 3D volume is\naggregated. In this work, we propose an SDF transformer network, which replaces\nthe role of 3D CNN for better 3D feature aggregation. To reduce the explosive\ncomputation complexity of the 3D multi-head attention, we propose a sparse\nwindow attention module, where the attention is only calculated between the\nnon-empty voxels within a local window. Then a top-down-bottom-up 3D attention\nnetwork is built for 3D feature aggregation, where a dilate-attention structure\nis proposed to prevent geometry degeneration, and two global modules are\nemployed to equip with global receptive fields. The experiments on multiple\ndatasets show that this 3D transformer network generates a more accurate and\ncomplete reconstruction, which outperforms previous methods by a large margin.\nRemarkably, the mesh accuracy is improved by 41.8%, and the mesh completeness\nis improved by 25.3% on the ScanNet dataset.

Although their trackers work well in\nregular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence\nto better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial\nprior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,\nit may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve\nor even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this\npaper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the\nGaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)\nsimultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced\nby multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed\ninto a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct\nsignal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled\nand combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will\nbe protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the\nSpatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a\nnovel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based\nSwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head\ncross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and\ntemplate features.

Prior research\nfocuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely\nexamines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability\nof generative transformers. In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving\nthe reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the\ngeneration. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ\ntokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture\ntextures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ\ntokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation.\nDifferent from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we\npropose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance\nthe two objectives.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal.

Using OAN, all five detectors acquire more\nthan 30.0% speed-up on three large-scale aerial image datasets, meanwhile with\nconsistent accuracy improvements. On extremely large Gaofen-2 images\n(29200$\\times$27620 pixels), our OAN improves the detection speed by 70.5%.\nMoreover, we extend our OAN to driving-scene object detection and 4K video\nobject detection, boosting the detection speed by 112.1% and 75.0%,\nrespectively, without sacrificing the accuracy.

However, negative pairs used for training are sampled randomly, which\nindicates that the semantics between negative pairs may be related or even\nequivalent, while most methods still enforce dissimilar representations to\ndecrease their similarity. This phenomenon leads to inaccurate supervision and\npoor performance in learning video-text representations.\n  While most video retrieval methods overlook that phenomenon, we propose an\nadaptive margin changed with the distance between positive and negative pairs\nto solve the aforementioned issue.

Specifically, past frames with targetness\nmasks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates\ntracked target cues from the memory to the current frame. To precisely localize\nobjects of all sizes, MBPTrack first predicts the target center via Hough\nvoting. By leveraging box priors given in the first frame, we adaptively sample\nreference points around the target center that roughly cover the target of\ndifferent sizes. Then, we obtain dense feature maps by aggregating point\nfeatures into the reference points, where localization can be performed more\neffectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, while\nrunning at 50 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU.\n","authors":["Tian-Xing Xu","Yuan-Chen Guo","Yu-Kun Lai","Song-Hai Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05071v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09590v3","updated":"2023-03-09T06:59:47Z","published":"2022-11-17T15:36:48Z","title":"Hypergraph Transformer for Skeleton-based Action Recognition","summary":"  Skeleton-based action recognition aims to predict human actions given human\njoint coordinates with skeletal interconnections.

Transformers assume that the input\nis permutation-invariant and homogeneous (partially alleviated by positional\nencoding), which ignores an important characteristic of skeleton data, i.e.,\nbone connectivity. Furthermore, each type of body joint has a clear physical\nmeaning in human motion, i.e., motion retains an intrinsic relationship\nregardless of the joint coordinates, which is not explored in Transformers. In\nfact, certain re-occurring groups of body joints are often involved in specific\nactions, such as the subconscious hand movement for keeping balance.

Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain under the\nassumption that the target domain contains unknown classes. Existing OSDA\nmethods consistently lay stress on the covariate shift, ignoring the potential\nlabel shift problem. The performance of OSDA methods degrades drastically under\nintra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. However, little\nattention has been paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, the\nImbalanced Open Set Domain Adaptation (IOSDA) is explored where the covariate\nshift, label shift and category mismatch exist simultaneously. To alleviate the\nnegative effects raised by label shift in OSDA, we propose Open-set\nMoving-threshold Estimation and Gradual Alignment (OMEGA) - a novel\narchitecture that improves existing OSDA methods on class-imbalanced data.\nSpecifically, a novel unknown-aware target clustering scheme is proposed to\nform tight clusters in the target domain to reduce the negative effects of\nlabel shift and intra-domain class imbalance. Furthermore, moving-threshold\nestimation is designed to generate specific thresholds for each target sample\nrather than using one for all.

Thus we\ncan scroll-refresh the database or even do nothing on the database to update.\n  The existing backward-compatible methods either require a strong overlap\nbetween old and new training data or simply conduct constraints at the instance\nlevel. Thus they are difficult in handling complicated cluster structures and\nare limited in eliminating the impact of outliers in old embeddings, resulting\nin a risk of damaging the discriminative capability of new features.

Unfortunately,\nthe generation process of current denoising diffusion models is notoriously\nslow due to the lengthy iterative noise estimations, which rely on cumbersome\nneural networks. It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed,\nespecially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of\ndiffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories.\nHowever, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in\nevery iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of\ncompressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining\nDMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce\npost-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output\ndistributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making\nprevious PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step\nscenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three\naspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric.

In this work, we\nintroduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization\n(TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on\nlatent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with\nrespect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that\nfeature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks.\nIn TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions\ndirectly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of\nlatent attributions in a fully-connected network.

Acute brain\ndysfunction status, delirium, is often underdiagnosed or undervalued. This\nstudy's objective was to develop automated computable phenotypes for acute\nbrain dysfunction states and describe transitions among brain dysfunction\nstates to illustrate the clinical trajectories of ICU patients. We created two\nsingle-center, longitudinal EHR datasets for 48,817 adult patients admitted to\nan ICU at UFH Gainesville (GNV) and Jacksonville (JAX). We developed algorithms\nto quantify acute brain dysfunction status including coma, delirium, normal, or\ndeath at 12-hour intervals of each ICU admission and to identify acute brain\ndysfunction phenotypes using continuous acute brain dysfunction status and\nk-means clustering approach. There were 49,770 admissions for 37,835 patients\nin UFH GNV dataset and 18,472 admissions for 10,982 patients in UFH JAX\ndataset. In total, 18% of patients had coma as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; every 12 hours, around 4%-7% would transit to delirium, 22%-25% would\nrecover, 3%-4% would expire, and 67%-68% would remain in a coma in the ICU.\nAdditionally, 7% of patients had delirium as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; around 6%-7% would transit to coma, 40%-42% would be no delirium, 1%\nwould expire, and 51%-52% would remain delirium in the ICU. There were three\nphenotypes: persistent coma/delirium, persistently normal, and transition from\ncoma/delirium to normal almost exclusively in first 48 hours after ICU\nadmission. We developed phenotyping scoring algorithms that determined acute\nbrain dysfunction status every 12 hours while admitted to the ICU.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks.

It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate\nday-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future\nscheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with\nultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional\noptimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in\nreinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this\nchallenge. However, the existing RL methods are inadequate in terms of\nconstraint complexity, algorithm performance, and environment fidelity. We are\nthe first to propose a systematic solution based on the state-of-the-art\nreinforcement learning algorithm and the real power grid environment. The\nproposed approach enables planning and finer time resolution adjustments of\npower generators, including unit commitment and economic dispatch, thus\nincreasing the grid's ability to admit more renewable energy. The well-trained\nscheduling agent significantly reduces renewable curtailment and load shedding,\nwhich are issues arising from traditional scheduling's reliance on inaccurate\nday-ahead forecasts. High-frequency control decisions exploit the existing\nunits' flexibility, reducing the power grid's dependence on hardware\ntransformations and saving investment and operating costs, as demonstrated in\nexperimental results.

Quite surprisingly training the\nneural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that\ngeneralize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla\ngradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good\napproximation of the solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm. The latter is\nwell-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results\nsignificantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient\nflow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal.

The\nfirst study tested a generic mode of influence - the Illusory Truth Effect\n(ITE) - where earlier exposure to a statement (through, for example, rating its\ninterest) boosts a later truthfulness test rating. Data was collected from 1000\nhuman participants using an online experiment, and 1000 simulated participants\nusing engineered prompts and LLM completion. 64 ratings per participant were\ncollected, using all exposure-test combinations of the attributes: truth,\ninterest, sentiment and importance. The results for human participants\nreconfirmed the ITE, and demonstrated an absence of effect for attributes other\nthan truth, and when the same attribute is used for exposure and test. The same\npattern of effects was found for LLM-simulated participants. The second study\nconcerns a specific mode of influence - populist framing of news to increase\nits persuasion and political mobilization. Data from LLM-simulated participants\nwas collected and compared to previously published data from a 15-country\nexperiment on 7286 human participants. Several effects previously demonstrated\nfrom the human study were replicated by the simulated study, including effects\nthat surprised the authors of the human study by contradicting their\ntheoretical expectations (anti-immigrant framing of news decreases its\npersuasion and mobilization); but some significant relationships found in human\ndata (modulation of the effectiveness of populist framing according to relative\ndeprivation of the participant) were not present in the LLM data.

We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of\nlanguage and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over\nstate-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and\ntrustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components.\nConcretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever),\nReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in\nchain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and\ngenerates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than\nbaselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making\nbenchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and\nreinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10%\nrespectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.\nProject site with code: https://react-lm.github.io\n","authors":["Shunyu Yao","Jeffrey Zhao","Dian Yu","Nan Du","Izhak Shafran","Karthik Narasimhan","Yuan Cao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629v3.pdf","comment":"v3 is the ICLR camera ready version with some typos fixed.

Although preserving legibility is a necessary\ncondition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically\ncharacterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via\nintuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility\nof visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and\nvision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether\nan input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given\nperturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

The proposed balance loss provides an\neffective discriminant for the quality of negative samples by combining a\nself-supervised approach to the loss function, and uses a dynamic gradient\nmodulation strategy to achieve finer gradient adjustment for samples of\ndifferent difficulties. The proposed annealing training strategy then\nconstrains the difficulty of the samples drawn from negative sample mining to\nprovide data sources with different difficulty distributions for the loss\nfunction, and uses samples of decreasing difficulty to train the model.\nExtensive experiments show that our new descriptors outperform previous\nstate-of-the-art descriptors for patch validation, matching, and retrieval\ntasks.\n","authors":["Jiahan Zhang","Dayong Tian"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06124v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13543v3","updated":"2023-03-10T18:30:42Z","published":"2019-05-28T06:35:52Z","title":"DDPNAS: Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Dynamic Distribution\n  Pruning","summary":"  Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has demonstrated state-of-the-art\nperformance on various computer vision tasks.

This paper presents ACR (Attention Collaboration-based\nRegressor), which makes the first attempt to reconstruct hands in arbitrary\nscenarios. To achieve this, ACR explicitly mitigates interdependencies between\nhands and between parts by leveraging center and part-based attention for\nfeature extraction.

First, a tedious process of manually tuning a hyperparameter\n$threshold$ is required for most OSDA approaches to separate common and unknown\nclasses. It is difficult to determine a proper threshold when the target domain\ndata is unlabeled. Second, most OSDA methods only rely on confidence values\npredicted by models to distinguish common/unknown classes.

Recent studies leverage the advantage\nof self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active\nsemantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class\nactivation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer\nneglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses\nthe semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization\nresults significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate\nWSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial\nrelationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a\nlearnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial\ncontext intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is\ndesigned as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during\ninference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization\nability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through\noptimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to\ncapture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant\nbackground area.

The majority of SLR works thereby adopt pretrained\nvisual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream\narchitectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA\nperformances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise.\nAlternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and\neffective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work,\nwe propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR,\nto fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language\nmodalities.

This contrastive learner uses a swapped prediction loss for\nimage segmentation that is computed using pixel-wise cluster assignments for\nthe image and its transformed variants. Using the hidden features from an\nalready pre-trained GAN for clustering, this leads to a much faster learning of\nthe pixel-wise feature vectors for one-shot segmentation. We have tested our\nimplementation on a number of standard benchmarks (CelebA, LSUN, PASCAL-Part)\nfor object and part segmentation. The results of our experiments yield a\nsegmentation performance that not only outperforms the semi-supervised baseline\nmethods with an average wIoU margin of 1.02 % but also improves the inference\nspeeds by a peak factor of 4.5. Finally, we also show the results of using the\nproposed framework in the implementation of BagGAN, a GAN-based framework for\nthe production of annotated synthetic baggage X-ray scans for threat detection.\nThis one-shot learning framework was trained and tested on the PIDRay baggage\nscreening benchmark for 5 different threat categories to yield a segmentation\nperformance which stands close to its baseline segmenter.\n","authors":["Ankit Manerikar","Avinash C.

So far, existing methods\nfor uncovering such artifactual behavior in trained models focus on finding\nartifacts in the input data, which requires both availability of a data set and\nhuman supervision. In this paper, we introduce DORA (Data-agnOstic\nRepresentation Analysis): the first data-agnostic framework for the analysis of\nthe representation space of DNNs. We propose a novel distance measure between\nrepresentations that utilizes self-explaining capabilities within the network\nitself without access to any data and quantitatively validate its alignment\nwith human-defined semantic distances.

The\npaper features an overview of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and extensions\nto account for partial observability and adversarial behavior. These models\nsufficiently capture aleatoric uncertainty but fail to account for epistemic\nuncertainty robustly. Consequently, we present a thorough overview of so-called\nuncertainty models that exhibit uncertainty in a more robust interpretation. We\nshow several solution techniques for both discrete and continuous models,\nranging from formal verification, over control-based abstractions, to\nreinforcement learning. As an integral part of this paper, we list and discuss\nseveral key challenges that arise when dealing with rich types of uncertainty\nin a model-based fashion.\n","authors":["Thom Badings","Thiago D.

Short-term intraday trading becomes increasingly important due to\nthe higher penetration of renewables. In Germany, the intraday electricity\nprice typically fluctuates around the day-ahead price of the European Power\nEXchange (EPEX) spot markets in a distinct hourly pattern. This work proposes a\nprobabilistic modeling approach that models the intraday price difference to\nthe day-ahead contracts. The model captures the emerging hourly pattern by\nconsidering the four 15 min intervals in each day-ahead price interval as a\nfour-dimensional joint probability distribution. The resulting nontrivial,\nmultivariate price difference distribution is learned using a normalizing flow,\ni.e., a deep generative model that combines conditional multivariate density\nestimation and probabilistic regression. Furthermore, this work discusses the\ninfluence of different external impact factors based on literature insights and\nimpact analysis using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). The\nnormalizing flow is compared to an informed selection of historical data and\nprobabilistic forecasts using a Gaussian copula and a Gaussian regression\nmodel. Among the different models, the normalizing flow identifies the trends\nwith the highest accuracy and has the narrowest prediction intervals.

To address this need, many methods have\nbeen developed to synthetically induce gray matter (GM) atrophy in an MRI via\ndeformable registration, creating a set of images with known changes in\ncortical thickness. However, these methods often cause blurring in atrophied\nregions, and cannot simulate realistic atrophy within deep sulci where\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obscured or absent. In this paper, we present a\nsolution using a self-supervised inpainting model to generate CSF in these\nregions and create images with more plausible GM/CSF boundaries. Specifically,\nwe introduce a novel, 3D GAN model that incorporates patch-based dropout\ntraining, edge map priors, and sinusoidal positional encoding, all of which are\nestablished methods previously limited to 2D domains.

With an objective to tune a specific component of a DBMS (e.g.,\nindex selection, knobs tuning), the ML-based tuning agents have shown to be\nable to find better configurations than experienced database administrators.\nHowever, one critical yet challenging question remains unexplored -- how to\nmake those ML-based tuning agents work collaboratively. Existing methods do not\nconsider the dependencies among the multiple agents, and the model used by each\nagent only studies the effect of changing the configurations in a single\ncomponent. To tune different components for DBMS, a coordinating mechanism is\nneeded to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other. Also, we need to\ndecide how to allocate the limited tuning budget among the agents to maximize\nthe performance. Such a decision is difficult to make since the distribution of\nthe reward for each agent is unknown and non-stationary. In this paper, we\nstudy the above question and present a unified coordinating framework to\nefficiently utilize existing ML-based agents.

This study\ninvestigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between\ndisadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting\nof ride-hailing services. A two-pronged approach is taken to reduce the demand\nprediction bias. First, we develop a novel deep learning model architecture,\nnamed socially aware neural network (SA-Net), to integrate the\nsocio-demographics and ridership information for fair demand prediction through\nan innovative socially-aware convolution operation.

One of the\nmain challenges of ES is that calculating the mutual information requires\ncomputationally-costly approximation techniques.

We present extensive experiments\nshowing that AdapterSoup consistently improves performance to new domains\nwithout extra training. We also explore weight averaging of adapters trained on\nthe same domain with different hyper-parameters, and show that it preserves the\nperformance of a PLM on new domains while obtaining strong in-domain results.\nWe explore various approaches for choosing which adapters to combine, such as\ntext clustering and semantic similarity.

It is\nespecially important to adhere to pre-approved terminology and adapt to\ncorrected translations in domain-specific projects. Machine translation (MT)\nhas achieved significant progress in the area of domain adaptation. However,\nreal-time adaptation remains challenging. Large-scale language models (LLMs)\nhave recently shown interesting capabilities of in-context learning, where they\nlearn to replicate certain input-output text generation patterns, without\nfurther fine-tuning. By feeding an LLM at inference time with a prompt that\nconsists of a list of translation pairs, it can then simulate the domain and\nstyle characteristics.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

However, they did not consider a crucial factor that affects the\ncomputational cost from the input side: the input resolution. In this paper, we\npropose an altering resolution framework called AR-Seg for compressed videos to\nachieve efficient VSS. AR-Seg aims to reduce the computational cost by using\nlow resolution for non-keyframes. To prevent the performance degradation caused\nby downsampling, we design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module,\nand supervise it with a novel Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy.\nSpecifically, CReFF first makes use of motion vectors stored in a compressed\nvideo to warp features from high-resolution keyframes to low-resolution\nnon-keyframes for better spatial alignment, and then selectively aggregates the\nwarped features with local attention mechanism.

Such a trade-off is referred to as the\nstabilityplasticity dilemma and is a more general and challenging problem for\ncontinual learning. However, the inherent conflict between these two concepts\nmakes it seemingly impossible to devise a satisfactory solution to both of them\nsimultaneously. Therefore, we ask, \"is it possible to divide them into two\nproblems to conquer independently?\" To this end, we propose a\nprompt-tuning-based method termed PromptFusion to enable the decoupling of\nstability and plasticity. Specifically, PromptFusion consists of a carefully\ndesigned Stabilizer module that deals with catastrophic forgetting and a\nBooster module to learn new knowledge concurrently.

However, generating high-dimensional vertex sequences\nsequentially is error-prone because the upstream of the sequence remains static\nand cannot be refined based on downstream vertex information, even if there is\na significant location gap. Besides, with limited vertexes, the inferior\nfitting of objects with complex contours restricts the performance upper bound.\nTo deal with this dilemma, we propose a parallel vertex generation paradigm for\nsuperior high-dimension scalability with a diffusion model by simply modifying\nthe noise dimension. An intuitive materialization of our paradigm is Parallel\nVertex Diffusion (PVD) to directly set vertex coordinates as the generation\ntarget and use a diffusion model to train and infer.

CNNs also lack invariance\nin the classification of symmetric samples because CNNs can classify symmetric\nsamples differently. Considered together, the CNN lack of adversarial\nrobustness and the CNN lack of invariance mean that the classification of\nsymmetric adversarial samples can differ from their incorrect classification.\nCould symmetric adversarial samples revert to their correct classification?\nThis paper answers this question by designing a symmetry defense that inverts\nor horizontally flips adversarial samples before classification against\nadversaries unaware of the defense. Against adversaries aware of the defense,\nthe defense devises a Klein four symmetry subgroup that includes the horizontal\nflip and pixel inversion symmetries. The symmetry defense uses the subgroup\nsymmetries in accuracy evaluation and the subgroup closure property to confine\nthe transformations that an adaptive adversary can apply before or after\ngenerating the adversarial sample.

Most brain MRI images acquired from patients are\ncontrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1), with a growing interest in high-resolution T2\nimages (hrT2) to replace ceT1, which involves the use of a contrast agent. As\nhrT2 images are currently scarce, it is less likely to train robust machine\nlearning models to segment VS or other brain structures. In this work, we\npropose a weakly supervised machine learning approach that learns from only\nceT1 scans and adapts to segment two structures from hrT2 scans: the VS and the\ncochlea from the crossMoDA dataset. Our model 1) generates fake hrT2 scans from\nceT1 images and segmentation masks, 2) is trained using the fake hrT2 scans, 3)\npredicts the augmented real hrT2 scans, and 4) is retrained again using both\nthe fake and real hrT2.

We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the\nconsidered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four\ntypes efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used\ntest datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset.

When novel WM\ntracts, i.e., tracts not included in the existing annotated WM tracts, are to\nbe segmented, additional annotations of these novel WM tracts need to be\ncollected. Since tract annotation is time-consuming and costly, it is desirable\nto make only a few annotations of novel WM tracts for training the segmentation\nmodel, and previous work has addressed this problem by transferring the\nknowledge learned for segmenting existing WM tracts to the segmentation of\nnovel WM tracts.

While parallel fusion can benefit from long-term\ninformation, it suffers from increasing computational and memory overheads as\nthe fusion window size grows. Alternatively, BEVFormer adopts a recurrent\nfusion pipeline so that history information can be efficiently integrated, yet\nit fails to benefit from longer temporal frames. In this paper, we explore an\nembarrassingly simple long-term recurrent fusion strategy built upon the\nLSS-based methods and find it already able to enjoy the merits from both sides,\ni.e., rich long-term information and efficient fusion pipeline. A temporal\nembedding module is further proposed to improve the model's robustness against\noccasionally missed frames in practical scenarios.

To overcome the disadvantages of ATP bioluminescence,\nwe propose Ins-ATP, a non-invasive strategy, the first organoid ATP estimation\nmodel based on the high-throughput microscopic image. Ins-ATP directly\nestimates the ATP of organoids from high-throughput microscopic images, so that\nit does not influence the drug reactions of organoids. Therefore, the ATP\nchange of organoids can be observed for a long time to obtain more stable\nresults. Experimental results show that the ATP estimation by Ins-ATP is in\ngood agreement with those determined by ATP bioluminescence. Specifically, the\npredictions of Ins-ATP are consistent with the results measured by ATP\nbioluminescence in the efficacy evaluation experiments of different drugs.\n","authors":["Xuesheng Bian","Cheng Wang","Shuting Chen","Weiquan Liu","Sen Xu","Jinxin Zhu","Rugang Wang","Zexin Chen","Min Huang","Gang Li"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06796v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06015v2","updated":"2023-03-13T00:32:29Z","published":"2023-03-10T16:19:34Z","title":"Dynamic Y-KD: A Hybrid Approach to Continual Instance Segmentation","summary":"  Despite the success of deep learning methods on instance segmentation, these\nmodels still suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual learning\nscenarios. In this paper, our contributions for continual instance segmentation\nare threefold. First, we propose the Y-knowledge distillation (Y-KD), a\nknowledge distillation strategy that shares a common feature extractor between\nthe teacher and student networks. As the teacher is also updated with new data\nin Y-KD, the increased plasticity results in new modules that are specialized\non new classes. Second, our Y-KD approach is supported by a dynamic\narchitecture method that grows new modules for each task and uses all of them\nfor inference with a unique instance segmentation head, which significantly\nreduces forgetting. Third, we complete our approach by leveraging checkpoint\naveraging as a simple method to manually balance the trade-off between the\nperformance on the various sets of classes, thus increasing the control over\nthe model's behavior without any additional cost.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

Over the past two decades,\nthere has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,\nresulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of\nTensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI\nresearch, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean\nnature of signals. Fundamentally, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based\nclassifier that capitalizes on the second-order statistics of EEGs.

Graph-CSPNet utilizes graph-based techniques to characterize\nEEG signals in both the time and frequency domains, realizing the fundamental\nperspective of time-frequency analysis. The architecture of Graph-CSPNet is\nfurther simplified, offering greater flexibility to cope with variable\ntime-frequency resolution for signal segmentation and capturing localized\nfluctuations.

PDEBench allows researchers to\nextend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and\nto compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods. We also\npropose new evaluation metrics with the aim to provide a more holistic\nunderstanding of learning methods in the context of Scientific ML. With those\nmetrics we identify tasks which are challenging for recent ML methods and\npropose these tasks as future challenges for the community.

The guidelines cover several aspects from the technical/digital\nspecifications,e.g., recommended EEG derivations, to detailed sleep scoring\nrules accordingly to age. Automated sleep scoring systems have always largely\nexploited the standards as fundamental guidelines. In this context, deep\nlearning has demonstrated better performance compared to classical machine\nlearning. Our present work shows that a deep learning based sleep scoring\nalgorithm may not need to fully exploit the clinical knowledge or to strictly\nadhere to the AASM guidelines. Specifically, we demonstrate that U-Sleep, a\nstate-of-the-art sleep scoring algorithm, can be strong enough to solve the\nscoring task even using clinically non-recommended or non-conventional\nderivations, and with no need to exploit information about the chronological\nage of the subjects. We finally strengthen a well-known finding that using data\nfrom multiple data centers always results in a better performing model compared\nwith training on a single cohort. Indeed, we show that this latter statement is\nstill valid even by increasing the size and the heterogeneity of the single\ndata cohort.

Many existing tools\nrely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees\nthat the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class\nof candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple\nlinear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be\nvacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings\nwhere UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear\nclassification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth\nfunction learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime. We\nprove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise\nthreshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in\nthese two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while\nany model that achieves at least a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-fraction of the max-margin\ngeneralizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail\nterribly. Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under\nslightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical\nmargin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides\ninsight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in\nthis challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,\nnear-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable\ncomponents and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence\nof the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal\nmargin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.\n","authors":["Margalit Glasgow","Colin Wei","Mary Wootters","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07892v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05205v2","updated":"2023-03-13T08:06:17Z","published":"2023-03-09T12:19:20Z","title":"Real-time scheduling of renewable power systems through planning-based\n  reinforcement learning","summary":"  The growing renewable energy sources have posed significant challenges to\ntraditional power scheduling.

In the feature pyramid\nof TriDet, we propose an efficient Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer\nto mitigate the rank loss problem of self-attention that takes place in the\nvideo features and aggregate information across different temporal\ngranularities. Benefiting from the Trident-head and the SGP-based feature\npyramid, TriDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging\nbenchmarks: THUMOS14, HACS and EPIC-KITCHEN 100, with lower computational\ncosts, compared to previous methods. For example, TriDet hits an average mAP of\n$69.3\\%$ on THUMOS14, outperforming the previous best by $2.5\\%$, but with only\n$74.6\\%$ of its latency.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show\nthat the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing\nproblem and solved efficiently in its dual space. During the online re-ranking\nphase, a momentum gradient descent method is designed to conduct the dynamic\nre-ranking. Theoretical analysis showed that the regret of P-MMF can be\nbounded.

Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product\nReviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of\nrecommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile\nusers and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past\ndecade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly\nconstrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as\nopposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate\nresearch for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset,\ncalled MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec from users' activity on the Google\nplay store. MobileRec contains 19.3 million user interactions (i.e., user\nreviews on apps) with over 10K unique apps across 48 categories. MobileRec\nrecords the sequential activity of a total of 0.7 million distinct users. Each\nof these users has interacted with no fewer than five distinct apps, which\nstands in contrast to previous datasets on mobile apps that recorded only a\nsingle interaction per user. Furthermore, MobileRec presents users' ratings as\nwell as sentiments on installed apps, and each app contains rich metadata such\nas app name, category, description, and overall rating, among others. We\ndemonstrate that MobileRec can serve as an excellent testbed for app\nrecommendation through a comparative study of several state-of-the-art\nrecommendation approaches.

In this work, we propose\na new framework, PPrior, that enables proactive prioritization of app issues\nthrough identifying prominent reviews (ones predicted to receive a large number\nof votes in a given time window). Predicting highly-voted reviews is\nchallenging given that, unlike social posts, social network features of users\nare not available. Moreover, there is an issue of class imbalance, since a\nlarge number of user reviews receive little to no votes. PPrior employs a\npre-trained T5 model and works in three phases. Phase one adapts the\npre-trained T5 model to the user reviews data in a self-supervised fashion.

However, this framework still requires a\ncentralized global model to consolidate individual models into one, and the\ndevices train synchronously, which both can be potential bottlenecks for using\nfederated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method of asynchronous\ndecentralized federated lifelong learning (ADFLL) method that inherits the\nmerits of federated learning and can train on multiple tasks simultaneously\nwithout the need for a central node or synchronous training. Thus, overcoming\nthe potential drawbacks of conventional federated learning. We demonstrate\nexcellent performance on the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) dataset for\nlocalizing the left ventricle on multiple image sequences and image\norientation. Our framework allows agents to achieve the best performance with a\nmean distance error of 7.81, better than the conventional all-knowing agent's\nmean distance error of 11.78, and significantly (p=0.01) better than a\nconventional lifelong learning agent with a distance error of 15.17 after eight\nrounds of training. In addition, all ADFLL agents have comparable or better\nperformance than a conventional LL agent.

While significant research progress has been made toward the development\nof dark pattern taxonomies, developers and users currently lack guidance to\nhelp recognize, avoid, and navigate these often subtle design motifs.

To do this, we introduce AidUI, a novel automated\napproach that uses computer vision and natural language processing techniques\nto recognize a set of visual and textual cues in application screenshots that\nsignify the presence of ten unique UI dark patterns, allowing for their\ndetection, classification, and localization.

Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and\nupscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR\nvia invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social\nmedia), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will\nlead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse\nupscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware\nimage rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an\nend-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for\nhigh-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical\nanalysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information\n(including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and\npropose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR\nimages in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize\nthe learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling\ndatasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under\nstandard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).\n","authors":["Jinhai Yang","Mengxi Guo","Shijie Zhao","Junlin Li","Li Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02353v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by AAAI 2023.

However, recent studies show\nthat the imbalanced optimization of uni-modal encoders in a joint-learning\nmodel is a bottleneck to enhancing the model's performance. We further find\nthat the up-to-date imbalance-mitigating methods fail on some audio-visual\nfine-grained tasks, which have a higher demand for distinguishable feature\ndistribution. Fueled by the success of cosine loss that builds hyperspherical\nfeature spaces and achieves lower intra-class angular variability, this paper\nproposes Multi-Modal Cosine loss, MMCosine. It performs a modality-wise $L_2$\nnormalization to features and weights towards balanced and better multi-modal\nfine-grained learning. We demonstrate that our method can alleviate the\nimbalanced optimization from the perspective of weight norm and fully exploit\nthe discriminability of the cosine metric. Extensive experiments prove the\neffectiveness of our method and the versatility with advanced multi-modal\nfusion strategies and up-to-date imbalance-mitigating methods.\n","authors":["Ruize Xu","Ruoxuan Feng","Shi-Xiong Zhang","Di Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05338v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04216v4","updated":"2023-03-11T14:49:56Z","published":"2022-10-09T10:10:13Z","title":"AMPose: Alternatively Mixed Global-Local Attention Model for 3D Human\n  Pose Estimation","summary":"  The graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to model the\nphysically connected and non-local relations among human joints for 3D human\npose estimation (HPE). In addition, the purely Transformer-based models\nrecently show promising results in video-based 3D HPE. However, the\nsingle-frame method still needs to model the physically connected relations\namong joints because the feature representations transformed only by global\nrelations via the Transformer neglect information on the human skeleton. To\ndeal with this problem, we propose a novel method in which the Transformer\nencoder and GCN blocks are alternately stacked, namely AMPose, to combine the\nglobal and physically connected relations among joints towards HPE. In the\nAMPose, the Transformer encoder is applied to connect each joint with all the\nother joints, while GCNs are applied to capture information on physically\nconnected relations. The effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated on\nthe Human3.6M dataset. Our model also shows better generalization ability by\ntesting on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

Existing methods adopt a predictive coding architecture, which\nrequires joint encoding to compress the corresponding disparity as well as\nresidual information. This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the\nepipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it\nchallenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly\noverlapping fields of view. Meanwhile, distributed source coding theory\nindicates that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved\nby independent encoding and joint decoding, which motivates us to design a\nlearning-based distributed multi-view image coding (LDMIC) framework. With\nindependent encoders, LDMIC introduces a simple yet effective joint context\ntransfer module based on the cross-attention mechanism at the decoder to\neffectively capture the global inter-view correlations, which is insensitive to\nthe geometric relationships between images. Experimental results show that\nLDMIC significantly outperforms both traditional and learning-based MIC methods\nwhile enjoying fast encoding speed.
