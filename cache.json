To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

While it has shown remarkable\nperformance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive\nto humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

This decoder is both data-efficient\nand computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,\neasing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require\nend-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but\nat the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.\nThe modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models\nthat prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix\nembedding.

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS. Practically, by providing early\ndetection and explaining the critical factors, DKDD can supplement clinical\ndepression screening and enable large-scale evaluations of a population's\nmental health status.\n","authors":["Wenli Zhang","Jiaheng Xie","Xiang Liu","Zhu Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05389v1.pdf","comment":"Presented at INFORMS 2022 Data Science Workshop"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05382v1","updated":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","published":"2023-03-06T16:36:17Z","title":"ChatGPT is on the horizon: Could a large language model be all we need\n  for Intelligent Transportation?","summary":"  ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is one of the largest Large Language Models\n(LLM) with over 175 billion parameters.

However, NSI and\nORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background,\nand large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated\nmethod is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay\nsufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the\nfinal saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose\na novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware\nAuxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary\nProtection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge\nposition information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level\nfeatures.

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs. In addition,\nexisting literature on modeling non-uniformity either assume user interests are\nindependent of the products, or lack theoretical understanding. In this paper,\nwe first model the user-product preferences as a partially observed matrix with\nnon-uniform observation pattern. Next, building on the literature about\nlow-rank matrix estimation, we introduce a new weighted trace-norm penalized\nregression to predict unobserved values of the matrix. We then prove an upper\nbound for the prediction error of our proposed approach. Our upper bound is a\nfunction of a number of parameters that are based on a certain weight matrix\nthat depends on the joint distribution of users and products.

However, segmenting or auto-localizing all fingerprints in a slap\nimage is a challenging task due to the different orientations of fingerprints,\nnoisy backgrounds, and the smaller size of fingertip components. The presence\nof slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are\nrotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and\nlabel the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and\nfinger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep\nlearning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from\nboth axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images. We built a fingerprint\nsegmentation model named CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation\nModel) by updating the previously proposed CFSEG model which was based on\ntraditional Faster R-CNN architecture [21]. CRFSEG improves upon the Faster\nR-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to\nperform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm\non a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children\nsubjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across\ndifferent age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully.

In order to extend UAP to the sequential decision\nsetting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise\n$\\delta$, as a $\\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\\delta$-MDP). Based\non the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\\delta$-MDP and propose two\nnovel Consistent Attack methods, named Reward UAP and Trajectory UAP, for\nattacking Embodied agents, which consider the dynamic of the MDP and calculate\nuniversal noises by estimating the disturbed distribution and the disturbed Q\nfunction. For various victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a\nsignificant drop in their performance in the PointGoal task in Habitat with\ndifferent datasets and different scenes. Extensive experimental results\nindicate that there exist serious potential risks for applying Embodied Vision\nNavigation methods to the real world.\n","authors":["Chengyang Ying","You Qiaoben","Xinning Zhou","Hang Su","Wenbo Ding","Jianyong Ai"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05751v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03041v1","updated":"2023-03-06T11:13:23Z","published":"2023-03-06T11:13:23Z","title":"Automatic detection of aerial survey ground control points based on\n  Yolov5-OBB","summary":"  The use of ground control points (GCPs) for georeferencing is the most common\nstrategy in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, but at the same time\ntheir collection represents the most time-consuming and expensive part of UAV\ncampaigns.

However,\noverlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be\nseparated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple\nclasses with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging\nbecause normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper\npresents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,\nspecifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing\non overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates\nellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then\nfinds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood\nsmear images was 0.889.

Therefore accurate AU recognition unlocks unbiaised face\nrepresentation which can improve face-based affective computing applications.\nFrom a learning standpoint AU detection is a multi-task problem with strong\ninter-task dependencies. To solve such problem, most approaches either rely on\nweight sharing, or add explicit dependency modelling by decomposing the joint\ntask distribution using Bayes chain rule. If the latter strategy yields\ncomprehensive inter-task relationships modelling, it requires imposing an\narbitrary order into an unordered task set. Crucially, this ordering choice has\nbeen identified as a source of performance variations. In this paper, we\npresent Multi-Order Network (MONET), a multi-task method with joint task order\noptimization. MONET uses a differentiable order selection to jointly learn\ntask-wise modules with their optimal chaining order. Furthermore, we introduce\nwarmup and order dropout to enhance order selection by encouraging order\nexploration.

Conventional methods\nsuffer from the trade-off between consistency and fine-grained details due to\nthe local-receptive field limiting their practicality. This lack of long-range\ndependency inherently comes from the convolutional neural network part of the\narchitecture. In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely\nDwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for\nend-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware\nfeatures while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of\nlocal and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and\nlong-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally\nexpensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,\nDwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such\nas translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.\nFurthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which\nmay result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing\nencoder and decoder features. In contrast, the Dwin-CAT employs both local and\nglobal window cross-attention to seamlessly fuse encoder and decoder features\nwith both fine-grained local and contextually aware global information,\neffectively amending semantic gap.

However, these methods require pixel-wise ground-truth labels, which can\nbe time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised\nframework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel\nground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence\nof images and comprises two networks.

During the test phase, the input images are\nprocessed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic\nbackground images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove\ndynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a\nforeground image that is free of dynamic artifacts.

Artificial neural networks come nowhere close: when\ntasked with learning to classify objects by training on non-repeating video\nframes in temporal order (online stream learning), models that learn well from\nshuffled datasets catastrophically forget old knowledge upon learning new\nstimuli. We propose a new continual learning algorithm, Compositional Replay\nUsing Memory Blocks (CRUMB), which mitigates forgetting by replaying feature\nmaps reconstructed by recombining generic parts. Just as crumbs together form a\nloaf of bread, we concatenate trainable and re-usable \"memory block\" vectors to\ncompositionally reconstruct feature map tensors in convolutional neural\nnetworks. CRUMB stores the indices of memory blocks used to reconstruct new\nstimuli, enabling replay of specific memories during later tasks.

In this paper, we propose masked video distillation\n(MVD), a simple yet effective two-stage masked feature modeling framework for\nvideo representation learning: firstly we pretrain an image (or video) model by\nrecovering low-level features of masked patches, then we use the resulting\nfeatures as targets for masked feature modeling. For the choice of teacher\nmodels, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on\ntemporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial\nrepresentations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also\nindicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students.\nMotivated by this observation, we design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method\nfor MVD.

In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach for the multi-agent efficient domain coverage problem involving agents\nwith second-order dynamics. Our approach is based on the Multi-Agent Proximal\nPolicy Optimization Algorithm (MAPPO). Our proposed network architecture\nincludes the incorporation of LSTM and self-attention, which allows the trained\npolicy to adapt to a variable number of agents. Our trained policy\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art classical control policy.

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x.

If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper.

By opti-mizing CNN hyperparameters with LDWPSO,\nlearning the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we compare the accuracy with a\nstandard CNN based on LeNet-5. As a result, when using the MNIST dataset, the\nbaseline CNN is 94.02% at the 5th epoch, compared to 98.95% for LDWPSO CNN,\nwhich improves accuracy. When using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the Baseline CNN is\n28.07% at the 10th epoch, compared to 69.37% for the LDWPSO CNN, which greatly\nimproves accuracy.

In the current paper, we propose an improved distance\nmeasure between two multi-fields by computing a multi-dimensional Reeb graph\n(MDRG) each of which captures the topology of a multi-field through a hierarchy\nof Reeb graphs in different dimensions. A hierarchy of persistence diagrams is\nthen constructed by computing a persistence diagram corresponding to each Reeb\ngraph of the MDRG.

In this\npaper, we try to marry these two systems for text classification via a\nstructured language model. We propose a Symbolic-Neural model that can learn to\nexplicitly predict class labels of text spans from a constituency tree without\nrequiring any access to span-level gold labels. As the structured language\nmodel learns to predict constituency trees in a self-supervised manner, only\nraw texts and sentence-level labels are required as training data, which makes\nit essentially a general constituent-level self-interpretable classification\nmodel.

On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space.

To provide empirical\nvalidation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three\nmodern baselines -- arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping --\nusing GPT-2 and WaveRNN as communication channels. We find that the minimum\nentropy coupling-based approach yields superior encoding efficiency, despite\nits stronger security constraints.

However, modern\nmultimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it\nchallenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the\ninternal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to\nfill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of\nmultimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages:\n(1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream\nmodeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities\nrelate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and\ncross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4)\nmultimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a\nprediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models,\ntasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6\nreal-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together\nenable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable\nconcepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications,\nand (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models.

We investigate two setups-ICL with\nflipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model\nfamilies (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments\non ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent\nability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels\npresented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from\npretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with\nin-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic\npriors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label\nICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs\n(e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models\nto learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to\nperform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale,\nand large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a\nSUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that\ninstruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity\nto learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.\n","authors":["Jerry Wei","Jason Wei","Yi Tay","Dustin Tran","Albert Webson","Yifeng Lu","Xinyun Chen","Hanxiao Liu","Da Huang","Denny Zhou","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03846v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13149v2","updated":"2023-03-07T12:22:00Z","published":"2023-02-25T20:24:58Z","title":"STACC: Code Comment Classification using SentenceTransformers","summary":"  Code comments are a key resource for information about software artefacts.\nDepending on the use case, only some types of comments are useful.

If prosody transfer methods do indeed\ntransfer prosody they should be able to be trained in the way we propose.\nHowever, results show that a model trained under these conditions performs\nsignificantly worse than one trained using the target utterance as a reference.\nTo explain this, we hypothesize that prosody transfer models do not learn a\ntransferable representation of prosody, but rather an utterance-level\nrepresentation which is highly dependent on both the reference speaker and\nreference text.\n","authors":["Atli Thor Sigurgeirsson","Simon King"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04289v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted in ICASSP 2023, 5 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09697v5","updated":"2023-03-07T23:09:55Z","published":"2020-10-19T17:40:38Z","title":"Effects of Parameter Norm Growth During Transformer Training: Inductive\n  Bias from Gradient Descent","summary":"  The capacity of neural networks like the widely adopted transformer is known\nto be very high.

Besides other criticisms, like\ncreating filter bubbles within social networks, recommender systems are often\nreproved for collecting considerable amounts of personal data. However, to\npersonalize recommendations, personal information is fundamentally required. A\nrecent distributed learning scheme called federated learning has made it\npossible to learn from personal user data without its central collection.\nAccordingly, we present a complete recommender system for movie\nrecommendations, which provides privacy and thus trustworthiness on two levels:\nFirst, it is trained using federated learning and thus is, by its very nature,\nprivacy-preserving, while still enabling individual users to benefit from\nglobal insights. And second, a novel federated learning scheme, FedQ, is\nemployed, which not only addresses the problem of non-i.i.d. and small local\ndatasets, but also prevents input data reconstruction attacks by aggregating\nclient models early.

In this paper, we resort to cloud\nrendering and present NEPHELE, a neural platform for highly realistic cloud\nradiance rendering.

Fortunately,\ncontrastive multimodal models have been shown to be highly effective at\naligning entities in images/videos and text, e.g., CLIP; text contrastive\nmodels have been extensively studied recently for their strong ability of\nproducing discriminative sentence embeddings, e.g., SimCSE. Their abilities are\nexactly needed by multi-channel video-language retrieval. However, there is not\na clear way to quickly adapt these two lines to multi-channel video-language\nretrieval with limited data and resources. In this paper, we identify a\nprincipled model design space with two axes: how to represent videos and how to\nfuse video and text information. Based on categorization of recent methods, we\ninvestigate the options of representing videos using continuous feature vectors\nor discrete text tokens; for the fusion method, we explore the use of a\nmultimodal transformer or a pretrained contrastive text model. We extensively\nevaluate the four combinations on five video-language datasets. We surprisingly\nfind that discrete text tokens coupled with a pretrained contrastive text model\nyields the best performance, which can even outperform state-of-the-art on the\niVQA and How2QA datasets without the additional training on millions of\nvideo-language data. Further analysis shows that this is because representing\nvideos as text tokens captures the key visual information with text tokens that\nare naturally aligned with text models and the text models are strong\nmultimodal retriever after the contrastive pretraining process.\n","authors":["Xudong Lin","Simran Tiwari","Shiyuan Huang","Manling Li","Mike Zheng Shou","Heng Ji","Shih-Fu Chang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02082v3.pdf","comment":"To appear in CVPR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10768v2","updated":"2023-03-07T15:11:10Z","published":"2023-01-19T11:11:57Z","title":"On the Importance of Sign Labeling: The Hamburg Sign Language Notation\n  System Case Study","summary":"  Labeling is the cornerstone of supervised machine learning, which has been\nexploited in a plethora of various applications, with sign language recognition\nbeing one of them.

However, the spin is challenging to measure because\nof the ball's high velocity and the magnitude of the spin values. Existing\nmethods either require extremely high framerate cameras or are unreliable\nbecause they use the ball's logo, which may not always be visible. Because of\nthis, many table tennis-playing robots ignore the spin, which severely limits\ntheir capabilities. This paper proposes an easily implementable and reliable\nspin estimation method. We developed a dotted-ball orientation estimation (DOE)\nmethod, that can then be used to estimate the spin. The dots are first\nlocalized on the image using a CNN and then identified using geometric hashing.\nThe spin is finally regressed from the estimated orientations. Using our\nalgorithm, the ball's orientation can be estimated with a mean error of\n2.4{\\deg} and the spin estimation has an relative error lower than 1%. Spins up\nto 175 rps are measurable with a camera of 350 fps in real time.

However, it still remains\nchallenging to craft targeted adversarial examples with higher transferability\nthan non-targeted ones. Recent studies reveal that the traditional\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted\nadversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we\nprovide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the\nlogit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain\nsaturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this\npaper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along\nthe optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and\neffective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the\nlogits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively. Both of\nthem can effectively encourage optimization to produce a larger logit margin\nand lead to higher transferability.

It is thus important to propose\neffective fingerprint presentation attack detection (PAD) methods for the\nsafety and reliability of AFRSs. However, current PAD methods often exhibit\npoor robustness under new attack types settings. This paper thus proposes a\nnovel channel-wise feature denoising fingerprint PAD (CFD-PAD) method by\nhandling the redundant noise information ignored in previous studies. The\nproposed method learns important features of fingerprint images by weighing the\nimportance of each channel and identifying discriminative channels and \"noise\"\nchannels. Then, the propagation of \"noise\" channels is suppressed in the\nfeature map to reduce interference. Specifically, a PA-Adaptation loss is\ndesigned to constrain the feature distribution to make the feature distribution\nof live fingerprints more aggregate and that of spoof fingerprints more\ndisperse. Experimental results evaluated on the LivDet 2017 dataset showed that\nthe proposed CFD-PAD can achieve a 2.53% average classification error (ACE) and\na 93.83% true detection rate when the false detection rate equals 1.0%\n(TDR@FDR=1%).

In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely\nDwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for\nend-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window\nself-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,\nrespectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware\nfeatures while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of\nlocal and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and\nlong-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally\nexpensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,\nDwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such\nas translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.\nFurthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which\nmay result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing\nencoder and decoder features.

Different\nfrom dropping attention weights in literature, we propose to move dropout\noperations forward ahead of attention matrix calculation and set the Key as the\ndropout unit, yielding a novel dropout-before-softmax scheme. We theoretically\nverify that this scheme helps keep both regularization and probability features\nof attention weights, alleviating the overfittings problem to specific patterns\nand enhancing the model to globally capture vital information; Second, how to\nschedule the drop ratio in consecutive layers? In contrast to exploit a\nconstant drop ratio for all layers, we present a new decreasing schedule that\ngradually decreases the drop ratio along the stack of self-attention layers. We\nexperimentally validate the proposed schedule can avoid overfittings in\nlow-level features and missing in high-level semantics, thus improving the\nrobustness and stableness of model training; Third, whether need to perform\nstructured dropout operation as CNN?

It first disentangles\nthe content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are\nthen recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this\nway, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,\nand simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different\nattributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face\ngeometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with\nlatent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier\nDisentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents\nidentifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative\ndescriptions.

Besides, there can be images with\nrare characteristics that make it difficult to find similar example images,\nwhich we call isolated samples. Here, we introduce a novel sketch-based medical\nimage retrieval (SBMIR) system that enables users to find images of interest\nwithout example images. The key idea lies in feature decomposition of medical\nimages, whereby the entire feature of a medical image can be decomposed into\nand reconstructed from normal and abnormal features. By extending this idea,\nour SBMIR system provides an easy-to-use two-step graphical user interface:\nusers first select a template image to specify a normal feature and then draw a\nsemantic sketch of the disease on the template image to represent an abnormal\nfeature. Subsequently, it integrates the two kinds of input to construct a\nquery vector and retrieves reference images with the closest reference vectors.\nUsing two datasets, ten healthcare professionals with various clinical\nbackgrounds participated in the user test for evaluation. As a result, our\nSBMIR system enabled users to overcome previous challenges, including image\nretrieval based on fine-grained image characteristics, image retrieval without\nexample images, and image retrieval for isolated samples.

Theoretically, VIP can be understood as a novel\nimplicit time contrastive objective that generates a temporally smooth\nembedding, enabling the value function to be implicitly defined via the\nembedding distance, which can then be used to construct the reward for any\ngoal-image specified downstream task.

This potentially unauthorized usage of\nonline data leads to concerns regarding data privacy. Recent works aim to make\nunlearnable data for deep learning models by adding small, specially designed\nnoises to tackle this issue. However, these methods are vulnerable to\nadversarial training (AT) and/or are computationally heavy. In this work, we\npropose a novel, model-free, Convolution-based Unlearnable DAtaset (CUDA)\ngeneration technique. CUDA is generated using controlled class-wise\nconvolutions with filters that are randomly generated via a private key. CUDA\nencourages the network to learn the relation between filters and labels rather\nthan informative features for classifying the clean data. We develop some\ntheoretical analysis demonstrating that CUDA can successfully poison Gaussian\nmixture data by reducing the clean data performance of the optimal Bayes\nclassifier. We also empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CUDA with\nvarious datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), and\narchitectures (ResNet-18, VGG-16, Wide ResNet-34-10, DenseNet-121, DeIT,\nEfficientNetV2-S, and MobileNetV2). Our experiments show that CUDA is robust to\nvarious data augmentations and training approaches such as smoothing, AT with\ndifferent budgets, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. For instance, training a\nResNet-18 on ImageNet-100 CUDA achieves only 8.96$\\%$, 40.08$\\%$, and 20.58$\\%$\nclean test accuracies with empirical risk minimization (ERM), $L_{\\infty}$ AT,\nand $L_{2}$ AT, respectively.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\ngraph-based approach, SKGHOI (Spatial-Semantic Knowledge Graph for Human-Object\nInteraction Detection), that effectively captures the sentiment representation\nof HOIs by integrating both spatial and semantic knowledge.

Most previous\napproaches have opted to learn a single representation of query images, which\nare then classified at different levels of geographic granularity. These\napproaches fail to exploit the different visual cues that give context to\ndifferent hierarchies, such as the country, state, and city level. To this end,\nwe introduce an end-to-end transformer-based architecture that exploits the\nrelationship between different geographic levels (which we refer to as\nhierarchies) and the corresponding visual scene information in an image through\nhierarchical cross-attention. We achieve this by learning a query for each\ngeographic hierarchy and scene type.

This paper proposes a\nnovel and end-to-end integrated framework for high resolution and attribute\npreservation face swapping via Adaptive Latent Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we first design a multi-task dual-space face encoder by sharing\nthe underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial\nregion perception and face encoding. This encoder enables us to control the\nface pose and attribute individually, thus enhancing the face swapping quality.\nNext, we propose an adaptive latent codes swapping module to adaptively learn\nthe mapping between the facial attributes and the latent codes and select\neffective latent codes for improved retention of facial attributes. Finally,\nthe initial face swapping image generated by StyleGAN2 is blended with the\nfacial region mask generated by our encoder to address the background blur\nproblem.

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

By incorporating input distributions and prior knowledge, the FIFK\noperator can address the limitations of using high-dimensional input\ndistributions by semi-supervised assumptions, leading to more precise\napproximations of the integral operator. Additionally, the FIFK's incorporation\nof probabilistic principles can further enhance the accuracy and effectiveness\nof solutions. In cases of noisy operator equations and limited data, the FIFK's\nflexibility in defining problems using prior information or cross-validation\nwith various kernel designs is especially advantageous.

To understand how these two perspectives affect\noverall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we conduct a large-scale subjective\nstudy to collect human quality opinions on overall quality of videos as well as\nperceptions from aesthetic and technical perspectives.

This papers develops SBDMs in the infinite-dimensional setting, that is,\nwe model the training data as functions supported on a rectangular domain.\nBesides the quest for generating images at ever higher resolution our primary\nmotivation is to create a well-posed infinite-dimensional learning problem so\nthat we can discretize it consistently on multiple resolution levels. We\nthereby hope to obtain diffusion models that generalize across different\nresolution levels and improve the efficiency of the training process. We\ndemonstrate how to overcome two shortcomings of current SBDM approaches in the\ninfinite-dimensional setting. First, we modify the forward process to ensure\nthat the latent distribution is well-defined in the infinite-dimensional\nsetting using the notion of trace class operators. Second, we illustrate that\napproximating the score function with an operator network, in our case Fourier\nneural operators (FNOs), is beneficial for multilevel training.

Specially, the model which incorporates\nour CGF with ACVNet ranks $1^{st}$ on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards\namong all the published methods. We further propose an informative and concise\ncost volume, named Attention Feature Volume (AFV), which exploits a correlation\nvolume as attention weights to filter a feature volume. Based on CGF and AFV,\nthe proposed CGI-Stereo outperforms all other published real-time methods on\nKITTI benchmarks and shows better generalization ability than other real-time\nmethods.

This enables capturing visual information at fine time\ngranularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes\nevent cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid\nmotion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However,\nconvolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently\nperform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate -\ncurrent CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the\nframe rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera\nrates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal\nresolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach\nto enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that\nconsecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences\nbetween them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between\nconsecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant\nreduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the\ninference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to\nleverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain\nthe sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network.

The GRC provides\nglobal receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable\nparameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional\nfilter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input\nfeature map.

In this work, we adopt metamorphic testing\nto evaluate the robustness of HPE models and provide suggestions on the choice\nof HPE models for different applications. The robustness evaluation was\nconducted on four state-of-the-art models, namely MediaPipe hands, OpenPose,\nBodyHands, and NSRM hand. We found that on average more than 80\\% of the hands\ncould not be identified by BodyHands, and at least 50\\% of hands could not be\nidentified by MediaPipe hands when diagonal motion blur is introduced, while an\naverage of more than 50\\% of strongly underexposed hands could not be correctly\nestimated by NSRM hand. Similarly, applying occlusions on only four hand joints\nwill also largely degrade the performance of these models.

Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain under the\nassumption that the target domain contains unknown classes. Existing OSDA\nmethods consistently lay stress on the covariate shift, ignoring the potential\nlabel shift problem. The performance of OSDA methods degrades drastically under\nintra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. However, little\nattention has been paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, the\nImbalanced Open Set Domain Adaptation (IOSDA) is explored where the covariate\nshift, label shift and category mismatch exist simultaneously.

Appearance based methods utilize the\ncorrelation information of inter-frames to capture target object that commonly\nappears in a sequence.

To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained\nrepresentation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and\nlocal perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature\nresolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the\nsemantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information\naggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature\nalignment aggregation.

The intensity of the pandemic on a\ngiven territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying\nthe rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time\nevolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem\nformulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization.

VLMaps\ncan be autonomously built from video feed on robots using standard exploration\napproaches and enables natural language indexing of the map without additional\nlabeled data. Specifically, when combined with large language models (LLMs),\nVLMaps can be used to (i) translate natural language commands into a sequence\nof open-vocabulary navigation goals (which, beyond prior work, can be spatial\nby construction, e.g., \"in between the sofa and TV\" or \"three meters to the\nright of the chair\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) can be shared\namong multiple robots with different embodiments to generate new obstacle maps\non-the-fly (by using a list of obstacle categories).

Various techniques have been proposed to improve performance in\ngoal-conditioned environments, such as automatic curriculum generation and goal\nrelabeling. In this work, we explore a connection between off-policy\nreinforcement learning in goal-conditioned settings and knowledge distillation.\nIn particular: the current Q-value function and the target Q-value estimate are\nboth functions of the goal, and we would like to train the Q-value function to\nmatch its target for all goals. We therefore apply Gradient-Based Attention\nTransfer (Zagoruyko and Komodakis 2017), a knowledge distillation technique, to\nthe Q-function update. We empirically show that this can improve the\nperformance of goal-conditioned off-policy reinforcement learning when the\nspace of goals is high-dimensional.

Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by\ndevelopers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education\nintelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to\nthe immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified,\nso problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the\neducational blockchain.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network\n(GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational\nblockchains.

Instead,\nthe (downside) semivariance, which captures the negative deviation of a random\nvariable under its mean, is more suitable for risk-averse proposes. This paper\naims at optimizing the mean-semivariance (MSV) criterion in reinforcement\nlearning w.r.t. steady reward distribution. Since semivariance is\ntime-inconsistent and does not satisfy the standard Bellman equation, the\ntraditional dynamic programming methods are inapplicable to MSV problems\ndirectly.

At inference, any input of the hybrid model is assigned to\neither its interpretable or complex component based on a gating mechanism. The\nadvantages of such models over classical ones are two-fold: 1) They grant users\nprecise control over the level of transparency of the system and 2) They can\npotentially perform better than a standalone black box since redirecting some\nof the inputs to an interpretable model implicitly acts as regularization.\nStill, despite their high potential, hybrid models remain under-studied in the\ninterpretability/explainability literature. In this paper, we remedy this fact\nby presenting a thorough investigation of such models from three perspectives:\nTheory, Taxonomy, and Methods. First, we explore the theory behind the\ngeneralization of hybrid models from the Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)\nperspective. A consequence of our PAC guarantee is the existence of a sweet\nspot for the optimal transparency of the system. When such a sweet spot is\nattained, a hybrid model can potentially perform better than a standalone black\nbox. Secondly, we provide a general taxonomy for the different ways of training\nhybrid models: the Post-Black-Box and Pre-Black-Box paradigms. These approaches\ndiffer in the order in which the interpretable and complex components are\ntrained. We show where the state-of-the-art hybrid models Hybrid-Rule-Set and\nCompanion-Rule-List fall in this taxonomy.

In contrast, the follower\nholds private information about his payoff. Given asymmetric information on\nboth sides, an important question arises: \\emph{Does the leader's information\nadvantage outweigh the follower's?} We answer this question affirmatively in\nthis work, where we demonstrate that by adequately designing a signaling device\nthat reveals partial information regarding the leader's realized action to the\nfollower, the leader can achieve a higher expected utility than that without\nsignaling.

A cheap\nand effective way of detecting hazardous terrain is through the use of visual\ncameras, which ensure operational ability from atmospheric entry through\ntouchdown. Plagued by resource constraints and limited computational power,\ntraditional techniques for visual hazardous terrain detection focus on template\nmatching and registration to pre-built hazard maps. Although successful on\nprevious missions, this approach is restricted to the specificity of the\ntemplates and limited by the fidelity of the underlying hazard map, which both\nrequire extensive pre-flight cost and effort to obtain and develop. Terrestrial\nsystems that perform a similar task in applications such as autonomous driving\nutilize state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to successfully localize and\nclassify navigation hazards. Advancements in spacecraft co-processors aimed at\naccelerating deep learning inference enable the application of these methods in\nspace for the first time.

Through\nthe use of unsupervised domain adaptation we tailor YOCO for training by\nsimulation, removing the need for real-world annotated data and expensive\nmission surveying phases. We further improve the transfer of representative\nterrain knowledge between simulation and the real world through visual\nsimilarity clustering.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the impact of\ndifferent choices of linear and nonlinear architectures on the implicit bias of\nthe learned features and the adversarial perturbations, in both spatial and\nfrequency domains. We find that the high-frequency adversarial perturbations\nare critically dependent on the convolution operation because the\nspatially-limited nature of local convolutions induces an implicit bias towards\nhigh frequency features.

We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions).

To this end, we propose \"Physics\nAugmented Continuum Neural Radiance Fields\" (PAC-NeRF), to estimate both the\nunknown geometry and physical parameters of highly dynamic objects from\nmulti-view videos. We design PAC-NeRF to only ever produce physically plausible\nstates by enforcing the neural radiance field to follow the conservation laws\nof continuum mechanics. For this, we design a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian\nrepresentation of the neural radiance field, i.e., we use the Eulerian grid\nrepresentation for NeRF density and color fields, while advecting the neural\nradiance fields via Lagrangian particles. This hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian\nrepresentation seamlessly blends efficient neural rendering with the material\npoint method (MPM) for robust differentiable physics simulation. We validate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed framework on geometry and physical parameter\nestimation over a vast range of materials, including elastic bodies,\nplasticine, sand, Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, and demonstrate\nsignificant performance gain on most tasks.\n","authors":["Xuan Li","Yi-Ling Qiao","Peter Yichen Chen","Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula","Ming Lin","Chenfanfu Jiang","Chuang Gan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05512v1.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2023 Spotlight.

From a technical standpoint, it\nalso marked a drastic change in the favored architecture to design generative\nimage models. GANs used to be the de facto choice, with techniques like\nStyleGAN. With DALL-E 2, auto-regressive and diffusion models became the new\nstandard for large-scale generative models overnight. This rapid shift raises a\nfundamental question: can we scale up GANs to benefit from large datasets like\nLAION? We find that na\\\"Ively increasing the capacity of the StyleGAN\narchitecture quickly becomes unstable. We introduce GigaGAN, a new GAN\narchitecture that far exceeds this limit, demonstrating GANs as a viable option\nfor text-to-image synthesis. GigaGAN offers three major advantages. First, it\nis orders of magnitude faster at inference time, taking only 0.13 seconds to\nsynthesize a 512px image. Second, it can synthesize high-resolution images, for\nexample, 16-megapixel pixels in 3.66 seconds.

However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB\nsignals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for\nthe encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long\npre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the\npixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from\npre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning.\nDifferent from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked\nAutoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level\nrepresentations without interference during pre-training. For high-level\nsemantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder\nto capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level\nstructures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel\nvalues for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level\nand low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning\nconflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior\nvisual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE\nbase pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after\nfine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous\nstate-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%.

To overcome the\nproblem of performance and scalability of cryptographic tools in high\ndimensions, we propose several techniques to optimize the image registration\noperations by using gradient approximations, and by revisiting the use of\nhomomorphic encryption trough packing, to allow the efficient encryption and\nmultiplication of large matrices. We demonstrate our privacy preserving\nframework in linear and non-linear registration problems, evaluating its\naccuracy and scalability with respect to standard, non-private counterparts.\nOur results show that privacy preserving image registration is feasible and can\nbe adopted in sensitive medical imaging applications.\n","authors":["Riccardo Taiello","Melek Ãnen","Francesco Capano","Olivier Humbert","Marco Lorenzi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10120v6.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03709v2","updated":"2023-03-09T16:23:02Z","published":"2023-03-07T07:47:41Z","title":"Bootstrap The Original Latent: Learning a Private Model from a Black-box\n  Model","summary":"  In this paper, considering the balance of data/model privacy of model owners\nand user needs, we propose a new setting called Back-Propagated Black-Box\nAdaptation (BPBA) for users to better train their private models via the\nguidance of the back-propagated results of a Black-box foundation/source model.\nOur setting can ease the usage of foundation/source models as well as prevent\nthe leakage and misuse of foundation/source models.

In the first stage,\nstarting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level\nproperties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder)\nmodel. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent\ndiffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text\nand visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images.

If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the\ncalibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would\nbe different. In other words, a calibrator optimal on the calibration set would\nbe suboptimal on the OOD test set and thus has degraded performance. With this\nknowledge, we propose a simple and effective method named adaptive calibrator\nensemble (ACE) to calibrate OOD datasets whose difficulty is usually higher\nthan the calibration set. Specifically, two calibration functions are trained,\none for in-distribution data (low difficulty), and the other for severely OOD\ndata (high difficulty).

Nonetheless, visual speech is not as distinguishable as\naudio speech, making it difficult to develop a mapping from source speech\nphonemes to the target language text.

To further minimize the\ncross-modality gap and its impact on knowledge transfer, we suggest adopting\nmixed speech, which is created by interpolating audio and visual streams, along\nwith a curriculum learning strategy to adjust the mixing ratio as needed.\nMixSpeech enhances speech translation in noisy environments, improving BLEU\nscores for four languages on AVMuST-TED by +1.4 to +4.2.

Plenty of methods have\nbeen proposed for automatic brain tumor segmentation using four common MRI\nmodalities and achieved remarkable performance. In practice, however, it is\ncommon to have one or more modalities missing due to image corruption,\nartifacts, acquisition protocols, allergy to contrast agents, or simply cost.\nIn this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for brain tumor\nsegmentation with missing modalities. In the first stage, a multimodal masked\nautoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality\ndropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a\nreconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal\nrepresentations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework\nM3AE. Meanwhile, we employ model inversion to optimize a representative\nfull-modal image at marginal extra cost, which will be used to substitute for\nthe missing modalities and boost performance during inference. Then in the\nsecond stage, a memory-efficient self distillation is proposed to distill\nknowledge between heterogenous missing-modal situations while fine-tuning the\nmodel for supervised segmentation. Our M3AE belongs to the 'catch-all' genre\nwhere a single model can be applied to all possible subsets of modalities, thus\nis economic for both training and deployment.

Recently, deep\nlearning methods have made it possible to improve the performance of cell\ndetection. However, a detection network trained with training data under a\nspecific condition (source domain) may not work well on data under other\nconditions (target domains), which is called the domain shift problem. In\nparticular, cells are cultured under different conditions depending on the\npurpose of the research. Characteristics, e.g., the shapes and density of the\ncells, change depending on the conditions, and such changes may cause domain\nshift problems. Here, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for\ncell detection using a pseudo-cell-position heatmap, where the cell centroid is\nat the peak of a Gaussian distribution in the map and selective\npseudo-labeling. In the prediction result for the target domain, even if the\npeak location is correct, the signal distribution around the peak often has a\nnon-Gaussian shape. The pseudo-cell-position heatmap is thus re-generated using\nthe peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear Gaussian shape.

Recent volumetric methods learn to directly\npredict the TSDF volume and have demonstrated promising results in this task.\nHowever, most methods focus on how to extract and fuse the 2D features to a 3D\nfeature volume, but none of them improve the way how the 3D volume is\naggregated. In this work, we propose an SDF transformer network, which replaces\nthe role of 3D CNN for better 3D feature aggregation. To reduce the explosive\ncomputation complexity of the 3D multi-head attention, we propose a sparse\nwindow attention module, where the attention is only calculated between the\nnon-empty voxels within a local window. Then a top-down-bottom-up 3D attention\nnetwork is built for 3D feature aggregation, where a dilate-attention structure\nis proposed to prevent geometry degeneration, and two global modules are\nemployed to equip with global receptive fields. The experiments on multiple\ndatasets show that this 3D transformer network generates a more accurate and\ncomplete reconstruction, which outperforms previous methods by a large margin.\nRemarkably, the mesh accuracy is improved by 41.8%, and the mesh completeness\nis improved by 25.3% on the ScanNet dataset.

Although their trackers work well in\nregular scenarios, however, they simply flatten the 2D features into a sequence\nto better match the Transformer. We believe these operations ignore the spatial\nprior of the target object which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In\naddition, many works demonstrate that self-attention is actually a low-pass\nfilter, which is independent of input features or key/queries. That is to say,\nit may suppress the high-frequency component of the input features and preserve\nor even amplify the low-frequency information. To handle these issues, in this\npaper, we propose a unified Spatial-Frequency Transformer that models the\nGaussian spatial Prior and High-frequency emphasis Attention (GPHA)\nsimultaneously. To be specific, Gaussian spatial prior is generated using dual\nMulti-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and injected into the similarity matrix produced\nby multiplying Query and Key features in self-attention. The output will be fed\ninto a Softmax layer and then decomposed into two components, i.e., the direct\nsignal and high-frequency signal. The low- and high-pass branches are rescaled\nand combined to achieve all-pass, therefore, the high-frequency features will\nbe protected well in stacked self-attention layers. We further integrate the\nSpatial-Frequency Transformer into the Siamese tracking framework and propose a\nnovel tracking algorithm, termed SFTransT. The cross-scale fusion based\nSwinTransformer is adopted as the backbone, and also a multi-head\ncross-attention module is used to boost the interaction between search and\ntemplate features.

Prior research\nfocuses on improving the reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers but rarely\nexamines how the improvement in reconstruction affects the generation ability\nof generative transformers. In this paper, we surprisingly find that improving\nthe reconstruction fidelity of VQ tokenizers does not necessarily improve the\ngeneration. Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ\ntokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture\ntextures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ\ntokenizers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation.\nDifferent from previous work that only pursues better details preservation, we\npropose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance\nthe two objectives.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals).

Most previous methods of food\nrecognition firstly locate informative regions in some weakly-supervised\nmanners and then aggregate their features. However, location errors of\ninformative regions limit the effectiveness of these methods to some extent.\nInstead of locating multiple regions, we propose a Progressive\nSelf-Distillation (PSD) method, which progressively enhances the ability of\nnetwork to mine more details for food recognition. The training of PSD\nsimultaneously contains multiple self-distillations, in which a teacher network\nand a student network share the same embedding network. Since the student\nnetwork receives a modified image from its teacher network by masking some\ninformative regions, the teacher network outputs stronger semantic\nrepresentations than the student network. Guided by such teacher network with\nstronger semantics, the student network is encouraged to mine more useful\nregions from the modified image by enhancing its own ability. The ability of\nthe teacher network is also enhanced with the shared embedding network.

Transformers assume that the input\nis permutation-invariant and homogeneous (partially alleviated by positional\nencoding), which ignores an important characteristic of skeleton data, i.e.,\nbone connectivity. Furthermore, each type of body joint has a clear physical\nmeaning in human motion, i.e., motion retains an intrinsic relationship\nregardless of the joint coordinates, which is not explored in Transformers. In\nfact, certain re-occurring groups of body joints are often involved in specific\nactions, such as the subconscious hand movement for keeping balance.

Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge\nfrom a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain under the\nassumption that the target domain contains unknown classes. Existing OSDA\nmethods consistently lay stress on the covariate shift, ignoring the potential\nlabel shift problem. The performance of OSDA methods degrades drastically under\nintra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. However, little\nattention has been paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, the\nImbalanced Open Set Domain Adaptation (IOSDA) is explored where the covariate\nshift, label shift and category mismatch exist simultaneously. To alleviate the\nnegative effects raised by label shift in OSDA, we propose Open-set\nMoving-threshold Estimation and Gradual Alignment (OMEGA) - a novel\narchitecture that improves existing OSDA methods on class-imbalanced data.\nSpecifically, a novel unknown-aware target clustering scheme is proposed to\nform tight clusters in the target domain to reduce the negative effects of\nlabel shift and intra-domain class imbalance. Furthermore, moving-threshold\nestimation is designed to generate specific thresholds for each target sample\nrather than using one for all.

It prevents the diffusion models from being widely deployed,\nespecially on edge devices. Previous works accelerate the generation process of\ndiffusion model (DM) via finding shorter yet effective sampling trajectories.\nHowever, they overlook the cost of noise estimation with a heavy network in\nevery iteration. In this work, we accelerate generation from the perspective of\ncompressing the noise estimation network. Due to the difficulty of retraining\nDMs, we exclude mainstream training-aware compression paradigms and introduce\npost-training quantization (PTQ) into DM acceleration. However, the output\ndistributions of noise estimation networks change with time-step, making\nprevious PTQ methods fail in DMs since they are designed for single-time step\nscenarios. To devise a DM-specific PTQ method, we explore PTQ on DM in three\naspects: quantized operations, calibration dataset, and calibration metric.

We extensively ablate these design choices, demonstrating the key\nfactors that most affect performance, and arrive at a set of recommendations\nthat practitioners can readily apply, whether their data comprise a small\nnumber of expert demonstrations or large volumes of sub-optimal trajectories.\nWe see that correct application of these simple recommendations can provide a\n$\\mathbf{2.5\\times}$ improvement over existing approaches across a diverse set\nof competitive benchmarks, with no additional computational overhead.\n","authors":["Philip J.

Existing\nregularization techniques include broad modelling decisions such as choice of\narchitecture, loss functions, and optimization methods. In this work, we\nintroduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization\n(TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on\nlatent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with\nrespect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that\nfeature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks.\nIn TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions\ndirectly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of\nlatent attributions in a fully-connected network. Our regularizer encourages\nneurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set\nof diverse and specialized latent units.

Acute brain\ndysfunction status, delirium, is often underdiagnosed or undervalued. This\nstudy's objective was to develop automated computable phenotypes for acute\nbrain dysfunction states and describe transitions among brain dysfunction\nstates to illustrate the clinical trajectories of ICU patients. We created two\nsingle-center, longitudinal EHR datasets for 48,817 adult patients admitted to\nan ICU at UFH Gainesville (GNV) and Jacksonville (JAX). We developed algorithms\nto quantify acute brain dysfunction status including coma, delirium, normal, or\ndeath at 12-hour intervals of each ICU admission and to identify acute brain\ndysfunction phenotypes using continuous acute brain dysfunction status and\nk-means clustering approach. There were 49,770 admissions for 37,835 patients\nin UFH GNV dataset and 18,472 admissions for 10,982 patients in UFH JAX\ndataset. In total, 18% of patients had coma as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; every 12 hours, around 4%-7% would transit to delirium, 22%-25% would\nrecover, 3%-4% would expire, and 67%-68% would remain in a coma in the ICU.\nAdditionally, 7% of patients had delirium as the worst brain dysfunction\nstatus; around 6%-7% would transit to coma, 40%-42% would be no delirium, 1%\nwould expire, and 51%-52% would remain delirium in the ICU. There were three\nphenotypes: persistent coma/delirium, persistently normal, and transition from\ncoma/delirium to normal almost exclusively in first 48 hours after ICU\nadmission. We developed phenotyping scoring algorithms that determined acute\nbrain dysfunction status every 12 hours while admitted to the ICU.

However, instantaneous dependence is prevalent in many RL environments.\nFor instance, in the stock market, instantaneous dependence can exist between\ntwo stocks because the fluctuation of one stock can quickly affect the other\nand the resolution of price change is lower than that of the effect. In this\npaper, we prove that with few exceptions, ignoring instantaneous dependence can\nresult in suboptimal policy learning in MBRL. To address the suboptimality\nproblem, we propose a simple plug-and-play method to enable existing MBRL\nalgorithms to take instantaneous dependence into account.

Raw\nautomotive datasets are suitable candidates for self-supervised pre-training as\nthey generally are cheap to collect compared to annotations for tasks like 3D\nobject detection (OD). However, the development of masked autoencoders for\npoint clouds has focused solely on synthetic and indoor data. Consequently,\nexisting methods have tailored their representations and models toward small\nand dense point clouds with homogeneous point densities. In this work, we study\nmasked autoencoding for point clouds in an automotive setting, which are sparse\nand for which the point density can vary drastically among objects in the same\nscene. To this end, we propose Voxel-MAE, a simple masked autoencoding\npre-training scheme designed for voxel representations. We pre-train the\nbackbone of a Transformer-based 3D object detector to reconstruct masked voxels\nand to distinguish between empty and non-empty voxels. Our method improves the\n3D OD performance by 1.75 mAP points and 1.05 NDS on the challenging nuScenes\ndataset.

We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions).

By\nanalyzing this generating function, we find, in particular, that 1) the SGD\ndynamics exhibits several convergent and divergent regimes depending on the\nspectral distributions of the problem; 2) the convergent regimes admit explicit\nstability conditions, and explicit loss asymptotics in the case of power-law\nspectral distributions; 3) the optimal convergence rate can be achieved at\nnegative momenta.

It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate\nday-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future\nscheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with\nultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional\noptimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in\nreinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this\nchallenge.

In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla\ngradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good\napproximation of the solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm.

As a by-product, our results\nsignificantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient\nflow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals).

Hair and scalp-related diseases often go\nunnoticed in the beginning. Sometimes, a patient cannot differentiate between\nhair loss and regular hair fall. Diagnosing hair-related diseases is\ntime-consuming as it requires professional dermatologists to perform visual and\nmedical tests. Because of that, the overall diagnosis gets delayed, which\nworsens the severity of the illness. Due to the image-processing ability,\nneural network-based applications are used in various sectors, especially\nhealthcare and health informatics, to predict deadly diseases like cancers and\ntumors. These applications assist clinicians and patients and provide an\ninitial insight into early-stage symptoms. In this study, we used a deep\nlearning approach that successfully predicts three main types of hair loss and\nscalp-related diseases: alopecia, psoriasis, and folliculitis. However, limited\nstudy in this area, unavailability of a proper dataset, and degree of variety\namong the images scattered over the internet made the task challenging. 150\nimages were obtained from various sources and then preprocessed by denoising,\nimage equalization, enhancement, and data balancing, thereby minimizing the\nerror rate. After feeding the processed data into the 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) model, we obtained overall training accuracy of 96.2%, with a\nvalidation accuracy of 91.1%. The precision and recall score of alopecia,\npsoriasis, and folliculitis are 0.895, 0.846, and 1.0, respectively.

To further reach its full\npotential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the\nspeaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on\nthe physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication\ncontext. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most\neffective semantics for its listener.

As a result, the theoretical universal constructions based on these\nseparating invariants is unrealistically large.

The proposed approach uses automatic pseudo-labels collected from\nuser interactions to train a reward model that can be used to reject\nlow-scoring sample responses generated by the chatbot model at inference time.\nIntuitive evaluation metrics, such as mean conversation length (MCL), are\nintroduced as proxies to measure the level of engagement of deployed chatbots.\nA/B testing on groups of 10,000 new daily chatbot users on the Chai Research\nplatform shows that this approach increases the MCL by up to 70%, which\ntranslates to a more than 30% increase in user retention for a GPT-J 6B model.\nFuture work aims to use the reward model to realise a data fly-wheel, where the\nlatest user conversations can be used to alternately fine-tune the language\nmodel and the reward model.\n","authors":["Robert Irvine","Douglas Boubert","Vyas Raina","Adian Liusie","Vineet Mudupalli","Aliaksei Korshuk","Zongyi Liu","Fritz Cremer","Valentin Assassi","Christie-Carol Beauchamp","Xiaoding Lu","Thomas Rialan","William Beauchamp"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06135v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14228v4","updated":"2023-03-10T17:24:26Z","published":"2022-11-25T16:41:59Z","title":"GPT-3-driven pedagogical agents for training children's curious\n  question-asking skills","summary":"  In order to train children's ability to ask curiosity-driven questions,\nprevious research has explored designing specific exercises relying on\nproviding semantic and linguistic cues to help formulate such questions. But\ndespite showing pedagogical efficiency, this method is still limited as it\nrelies on generating the said cues by hand, which can be a very costly process.\nIn this context, we propose to leverage advances in the natural language\nprocessing field (NLP) and investigate the efficiency of using a large language\nmodel (LLM) for automating the production of the pedagogical content of a\ncurious question-asking (QA) training. We study generating the said content\nusing the \"prompt-based\" method that consists of explaining the task to the LLM\nin natural text.

Although preserving legibility is a necessary\ncondition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically\ncharacterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via\nintuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility\nof visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and\nvision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether\nan input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given\nperturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

This paper presents ACR (Attention Collaboration-based\nRegressor), which makes the first attempt to reconstruct hands in arbitrary\nscenarios. To achieve this, ACR explicitly mitigates interdependencies between\nhands and between parts by leveraging center and part-based attention for\nfeature extraction.

First, a tedious process of manually tuning a hyperparameter\n$threshold$ is required for most OSDA approaches to separate common and unknown\nclasses. It is difficult to determine a proper threshold when the target domain\ndata is unlabeled. Second, most OSDA methods only rely on confidence values\npredicted by models to distinguish common/unknown classes. The performance is\nnot satisfied, especially when the majority of the target domain consists of\nunknown classes.

The explicit modeling of occlusion relationship with bilayer\nstructure naturally decouples the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded\ninstances, and considers the interaction between them during mask regression.\nWe investigate the efficacy of bilayer structure using two popular\nconvolutional network designs, namely, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and\nGraph Convolutional Network (GCN). Further, we formulate bilayer decoupling\nusing the vision transformer (ViT), by representing instances in the image as\nseparate learnable occluder and occludee queries.

Recent studies leverage the advantage\nof self-attention in visual Transformer for long-range dependency to re-active\nsemantic regions, aiming to avoid partial activation in traditional class\nactivation mapping (CAM). However, the long-range modeling in Transformer\nneglects the inherent spatial coherence of the object, and it usually diffuses\nthe semantic-aware regions far from the object boundary, making localization\nresults significantly larger or far smaller. To address such an issue, we\nintroduce a simple yet effective Spatial Calibration Module (SCM) for accurate\nWSOL, incorporating semantic similarities of patch tokens and their spatial\nrelationships into a unified diffusion model. Specifically, we introduce a\nlearnable parameter to dynamically adjust the semantic correlations and spatial\ncontext intensities for effective information propagation. In practice, SCM is\ndesigned as an external module of Transformer, and can be removed during\ninference to reduce the computation cost. The object-sensitive localization\nability is implicitly embedded into the Transformer encoder through\noptimization in the training phase. It enables the generated attention maps to\ncapture the sharper object boundaries and filter the object-irrelevant\nbackground area.

Existing approaches to few-shot detection assume\nabundant base labels to adapt to novel objects. This paper explores the task of\nsemi-supervised few-shot detection by considering a realistic scenario which\nlacks abundant labels for both base and novel objects. Motivated by this unique\nproblem, we introduce SoftER Teacher, a robust detector combining the\nadvantages of pseudo-labeling with representation learning on region proposals.\nSoftER Teacher harnesses unlabeled data to jointly optimize for semi-supervised\nfew-shot detection without explicitly relying on abundant base labels.\nExtensive experiments show that SoftER Teacher matches the novel class\nperformance of a strong supervised detector using only 10% of base labels.

This paper proposes a Generative model-based Noise-Robust Training\nmethod (GeNRT), which eliminates domain shift while mitigating label noise.\nGeNRT incorporates a Distribution-based Class-wise Feature Augmentation (D-CFA)\nand a Generative-Discriminative classifier Consistency (GDC), both based on the\nclass-wise target distributions modelled by generative models. D-CFA minimizes\nthe domain gap by augmenting the source data with distribution-sampled target\nfeatures, and trains a noise-robust discriminative classifier by using target\ndomain knowledge from the generative models. GDC regards all the class-wise\ngenerative models as generative classifiers and enforces a consistency\nregularization between the generative and discriminative classifiers. It\nexploits an ensemble of target knowledge from all the generative models to\ntrain a noise-robust discriminative classifier and eventually gets\ntheoretically linked to the Ben-David domain adaptation theorem for reducing\nthe domain gap.

Recent studies show that insufficient training\ncaused by the lack of large-scale available sign language datasets becomes the\nmain bottleneck for SLR. The majority of SLR works thereby adopt pretrained\nvisual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream\narchitectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA\nperformances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise.\nAlternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit\ncross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and\neffective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work,\nwe propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR,\nto fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language\nmodalities. Based on the single-cue cross-modal alignment framework, we propose\na variational autoencoder (VAE) for pretrained contextual knowledge while\nintroducing the complete pretrained language module. The VAE implicitly aligns\nvisual and textual modalities while benefiting from pretrained contextual\nknowledge as the traditional contextual module. Meanwhile, a contrastive\ncross-modal alignment algorithm is proposed to further enhance the explicit\nconsistency constraints.

Most\nworks require extra data for semi-supervised learning and lack the\ninterpretability of the boundaries of the training data distribution during\ntraining, which is essential for model deployment in clinical practice. We\npropose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable\nsegmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an\nexplorable manifold during training. The proposed approach creates medical\nimage style paired with a segmentation task driven discriminator incorporating\nend-to-end adversarial training. The discriminator is generalised to small\ndomain shifts as much as permissible by the training data, and the generator\nautomatically diversifies the training samples using a manifold of input\nfeatures learnt during segmentation. All the while, the discriminator guides\nthe manifold learning by supervising the semantic content and fine-grained\nfeatures separately during the image diversification. After training,\nvisualisation of the learnt manifold from the generator is available to\ninterpret the model limits.

The\nimplementation of our framework is based on the observation that the\nmulti-scale hidden features produced by a GAN during image synthesis hold\nuseful semantic information that can be utilized for automatic segmentation.\nUsing these features, our proposed framework learns to segment synthetic images\nusing a novel self-supervised, contrastive clustering algorithm that projects\nthe hidden features in the generator onto a compact feature space for per-pixel\nclassification. This contrastive learner uses a swapped prediction loss for\nimage segmentation that is computed using pixel-wise cluster assignments for\nthe image and its transformed variants. Using the hidden features from an\nalready pre-trained GAN for clustering, this leads to a much faster learning of\nthe pixel-wise feature vectors for one-shot segmentation.

However, the\nsegmentation performance might be saturated and even degraded as the kernel\nsizes scaled up (e.g., $21\\times 21\\times 21$) in a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN).

To tune different components for DBMS, a coordinating mechanism is\nneeded to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other.

This study\ninvestigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between\ndisadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting\nof ride-hailing services. A two-pronged approach is taken to reduce the demand\nprediction bias.

We\npropose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable\nsegmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an\nexplorable manifold during training.

Our approach decomposes the performance drop into terms for 1) an\nincrease in harder but frequently seen examples from training, 2) changes in\nthe relationship between features and outcomes, and 3) poor performance on\nexamples infrequent or unseen during training. These terms are defined by\nfixing a distribution on $X$ while varying the conditional distribution of $Y\n\\mid X$ between training and target, or by fixing the conditional distribution\nof $Y \\mid X$ while varying the distribution on $X$.

Existing works on this topic primarily focus on improving the\noverall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignore the underlying\nchallenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performances on some\ncritical tasks. This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic\nvolume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by undetected\nmovements, and (2) non-equilibrium traffic flows arise from congestion\npropagation. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that can\noffer a data-driven, model-free and correlation adaptive approach to tackle the\nabove issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation.\nParticularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear relationships\nbetween traffic speed and volume for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a\nspeed patternadaptive adjacent matrix based on graph attention is developed and\nintegrated into the graph convolution process, to capture non-local\ncorrelations between sensors. To measure the impacts of non-equilibrium flows,\na temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal\nconvolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations\nbetween upstream and downstream sensors. We then evaluate our model on a\nreal-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark\nmodels.

Existing video-and-language understanding methods\ngenerally adopt heavy multi-modal encoders and feature fusion modules, which\nconsume large amounts of GPU memory.

In this paper, we propose MuLTI, a highly accurate and\nmemory-efficient video-and-language understanding model that achieves efficient\nand effective feature fusion through feature sampling and attention modules.\nTherefore, MuLTI can handle longer sequences with limited GPU memory. Then, we\nintroduce an attention-based adapter to the encoders, which finetunes the\nshallow features to improve the model's performance with low GPU memory\nconsumption. Finally, to further improve the model's performance, we introduce\na new pretraining task named Multiple Choice Modeling to bridge the task gap\nbetween pretraining and downstream tasks and enhance the model's ability to\nalign the video and the text. Benefiting from the efficient feature fusion\nmodule, the attention-based adapter and the new pretraining task, MuLTI\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

In this work, we demonstrate surprising\ngains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an\nalternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than modifying the\nmodel (by appending an MLP head), MVP instead modifies the input (by appending\na prompt template).

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

It is therefore important\nto test and improve the OOD robustness of HPS methods. To address this\nfundamental problem, we develop a simulator that can be controlled in a\nfine-grained manner using interpretable parameters to explore the manifold of\nimages of human pose, e.g. by varying poses, shapes, and clothes.

However, generating high-dimensional vertex sequences\nsequentially is error-prone because the upstream of the sequence remains static\nand cannot be refined based on downstream vertex information, even if there is\na significant location gap.

Considered together, the CNN lack of adversarial\nrobustness and the CNN lack of invariance mean that the classification of\nsymmetric adversarial samples can differ from their incorrect classification.\nCould symmetric adversarial samples revert to their correct classification?\nThis paper answers this question by designing a symmetry defense that inverts\nor horizontally flips adversarial samples before classification against\nadversaries unaware of the defense.

PDEBench comprises both code and data to\nbenchmark the performance of novel machine learning models against both\nclassical numerical simulations and machine learning baselines. Our proposed\nset of benchmark problems contribute the following unique features: (1) A much\nwider range of PDEs compared to existing benchmarks, ranging from relatively\ncommon examples to more realistic and difficult problems; (2) much larger\nready-to-use datasets compared to prior work, comprising multiple simulation\nruns across a larger number of initial and boundary conditions and PDE\nparameters; (3) more extensible source codes with user-friendly APIs for data\ngeneration and baseline results with popular machine learning models (FNO,\nU-Net, PINN, Gradient-Based Inverse Method). PDEBench allows researchers to\nextend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and\nto compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods.

Moreover, a\nnovel local graph embedding term is introduced to learn the structured\nconsensus representation.

Most existing methods rely on generative models\nlearning a face image distribution from a big dataset, which produces\nuncontrollable results, especially with large-scale missing regions. To\nintroduce strong control for face inpainting, we propose a novel\nreference-guided face inpainting method that fills the large-scale missing\nregion with identity and texture control guided by a reference face image.\nHowever, generating high-quality results under imposing two control signals is\nchallenging. To tackle such difficulty, we propose a dual control one-stage\nframework that decouples the reference image into two levels for flexible\ncontrol: High-level identity information and low-level texture information,\nwhere the identity information figures out the shape of the face and the\ntexture information depicts the component-aware texture.

We design a novel\nknowledge distillation objective, dubbed Dense-to-Sparse Knowledge Distillation\n(DSKD). It transfers the dense, relation-based semantic knowledge from the\nmulti-frame teacher to the single-frame student, significantly improving the\nrepresentation learning of the single-frame model. 3) Completion label\nrectification. We propose a simple yet effective label rectification strategy,\nwhich uses off-the-shelf panoptic segmentation labels to remove the traces of\ndynamic objects in completion labels, greatly improving the performance of deep\nmodels especially for those moving objects. Extensive experiments are conducted\nin two public SSC benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS.

Besides, our method also achieves\ncompetitive results on SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation tasks, showing that\nknowledge learned in the scene completion is beneficial to the segmentation\ntask.\n","authors":["Zhaoyang Xia","Youquan Liu","Xin Li","Xinge Zhu","Yuexin Ma","Yikang Li","Yuenan Hou","Yu Qiao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06884v1.pdf","comment":"CVPR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06881v1","updated":"2023-03-13T05:56:36Z","published":"2023-03-13T05:56:36Z","title":"OverlapNetVLAD: A Coarse-to-Fine Framework for LiDAR-based Place\n  Recognition","summary":"  Place recognition is a challenging yet crucial task in robotics.

Our\nmain objective is to address two issues in existing image translation\nbaselines, namely, the aimlessness in the translation process and\nincompleteness of the translated object. The former refers to the overall\nquality of the translated OCTA images being satisfactory, but the retinal\nvascular quality being low. The latter refers to incomplete objects in\ntranslated OCTA images due to the lack of global contexts. TransPro merges a 2D\nretinal vascular segmentation model and a 2D OCTA image translation model into\na 3D image translation baseline for the 2D projection map projected by the\ntranslated OCTA images. The 2D retinal vascular segmentation model can improve\nattention to the retinal vascular, while the 2D OCTA image translation model\nintroduces beneficial heuristic contextual information. Extensive experimental\nresults on two challenging datasets demonstrate that TransPro can consistently\noutperform existing approaches with minimal computational overhead during\ntraining and none during testing.\n","authors":["Shuhan Li","Dong Zhang","Xiaomeng Li","Chubin Ou","Lin An","Yanwu Xu","Kwang-Ting Cheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06807v1.pdf","comment":"Code is available at: https://github.com/ustlsh/TransPro"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06800v1","updated":"2023-03-13T01:10:50Z","published":"2023-03-13T01:10:50Z","title":"Object-Centric Multi-Task Learning for Human Instances","summary":"  Human is one of the most essential classes in visual recognition tasks such\nas detection, segmentation, and pose estimation.

Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

Over the past two decades,\nthere has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,\nresulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of\nTensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI\nresearch, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean\nnature of signals.

First, we design two transformer-style based\nmodules for cross-view features aggregation and multi-label classification,\nrespectively. The former aggregates information from different views in the\nprocess of extracting view-specific features, and the latter learns subcategory\nembedding to improve classification performance.

PDEBench comprises both code and data to\nbenchmark the performance of novel machine learning models against both\nclassical numerical simulations and machine learning baselines. Our proposed\nset of benchmark problems contribute the following unique features: (1) A much\nwider range of PDEs compared to existing benchmarks, ranging from relatively\ncommon examples to more realistic and difficult problems; (2) much larger\nready-to-use datasets compared to prior work, comprising multiple simulation\nruns across a larger number of initial and boundary conditions and PDE\nparameters; (3) more extensible source codes with user-friendly APIs for data\ngeneration and baseline results with popular machine learning models (FNO,\nU-Net, PINN, Gradient-Based Inverse Method). PDEBench allows researchers to\nextend the benchmark freely for their own purposes using a standardized API and\nto compare the performance of new models to existing baseline methods. We also\npropose new evaluation metrics with the aim to provide a more holistic\nunderstanding of learning methods in the context of Scientific ML.

Automated sleep scoring systems have always largely\nexploited the standards as fundamental guidelines.

However, direct estimation of MI is intractable, even if the\ntrue joint probability density for the variables of interest is known, as it\ninvolves estimating a potentially high-dimensional log partition function. In\nthis work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the\nperspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on\nthis approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information\nrequires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single\nmarginal or the full joint density information is known. In settings where the\nfull joint density is available, we propose Multi-Sample Annealed Importance\nSampling (AIS) bounds on MI, which we demonstrate can tightly estimate large\nvalues of MI in our experiments. In settings where only a single marginal\ndistribution is known, we propose Generalized IWAE (GIWAE) and MINE-AIS bounds.\nOur GIWAE bound unifies variational and contrastive bounds in a single\nframework that generalizes InfoNCE, IWAE, and Barber-Agakov bounds. Our\nMINE-AIS method improves upon existing energy-based methods such as MINE-DV and\nMINE-F by directly optimizing a tighter lower bound on MI. MINE-AIS uses MCMC\nsampling to estimate gradients for training and Multi-Sample AIS for evaluating\nthe bound. Our methods are particularly suitable for evaluating MI in deep\ngenerative models, since explicit forms of the marginal or joint densities are\noften available. We evaluate our bounds on estimating the MI of VAEs and GANs\ntrained on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and showcase significant gains over\nexisting bounds in these challenging settings with high ground truth MI.\n","authors":["Rob Brekelmans","Sicong Huang","Marzyeh Ghassemi","Greg Ver Steeg","Roger Grosse","Alireza Makhzani"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06992v1.pdf","comment":"A shorter version appeared in the International Conference on\n  Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06980v1","updated":"2023-03-13T10:30:02Z","published":"2023-03-13T10:30:02Z","title":"Self-supervised based general laboratory progress pretrained model for\n  cardiovascular event detection","summary":"  Regular surveillance is an indispensable aspect of managing cardiovascular\ndisorders.

Many existing tools\nrely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees\nthat the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class\nof candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple\nlinear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be\nvacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings\nwhere UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear\nclassification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth\nfunction learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime. We\nprove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise\nthreshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in\nthese two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while\nany model that achieves at least a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-fraction of the max-margin\ngeneralizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail\nterribly. Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under\nslightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical\nmargin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides\ninsight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in\nthis challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,\nnear-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable\ncomponents and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence\nof the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal\nmargin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.\n","authors":["Margalit Glasgow","Colin Wei","Mary Wootters","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07892v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05205v2","updated":"2023-03-13T08:06:17Z","published":"2023-03-09T12:19:20Z","title":"Real-time scheduling of renewable power systems through planning-based\n  reinforcement learning","summary":"  The growing renewable energy sources have posed significant challenges to\ntraditional power scheduling.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show\nthat the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing\nproblem and solved efficiently in its dual space. During the online re-ranking\nphase, a momentum gradient descent method is designed to conduct the dynamic\nre-ranking. Theoretical analysis showed that the regret of P-MMF can be\nbounded.

Existing recommendation datasets, such as Amazon Product\nReviews and MovieLens, greatly facilitated the research and development of\nrecommender systems in their respective domains. While the number of mobile\nusers and applications (aka apps) has increased exponentially over the past\ndecade, research in mobile app recommender systems has been significantly\nconstrained, primarily due to the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, as\nopposed to recommendations for products, movies, and news. To facilitate\nresearch for app recommendation systems, we introduce a large-scale dataset,\ncalled MobileRec. We constructed MobileRec from users' activity on the Google\nplay store. MobileRec contains 19.3 million user interactions (i.e., user\nreviews on apps) with over 10K unique apps across 48 categories. MobileRec\nrecords the sequential activity of a total of 0.7 million distinct users. Each\nof these users has interacted with no fewer than five distinct apps, which\nstands in contrast to previous datasets on mobile apps that recorded only a\nsingle interaction per user. Furthermore, MobileRec presents users' ratings as\nwell as sentiments on installed apps, and each app contains rich metadata such\nas app name, category, description, and overall rating, among others.

In this work, we propose\na new framework, PPrior, that enables proactive prioritization of app issues\nthrough identifying prominent reviews (ones predicted to receive a large number\nof votes in a given time window). Predicting highly-voted reviews is\nchallenging given that, unlike social posts, social network features of users\nare not available. Moreover, there is an issue of class imbalance, since a\nlarge number of user reviews receive little to no votes. PPrior employs a\npre-trained T5 model and works in three phases.

Recently, image rescaling models like IRN utilize\nthe bidirectional nature of INN to push the performance limit of image\nupscaling by optimizing the downscaling and upscaling steps jointly. While the\nrandom sampling of latent variable $z$ is useful in generating diverse\nphoto-realistic images, it is not desirable for image rescaling when accurate\nrestoration of the HR image is more important. Hence, in places of random\nsampling of $z$, we propose auxiliary encoding modules to further push the\nlimit of image rescaling performance. Two options to store the encoded latent\nvariables in downscaled LR images, both readily supported in existing image\nfile format, are proposed. One is saved as the alpha-channel, the other is\nsaved as meta-data in the image header, and the corresponding modules are\ndenoted as suffixes -A and -M respectively.

Our study investigates this\nrelationship and introduces a robust method that combines features from\nmultiple segmentation models to improve MI classification performance by\nleveraging ensemble learning. Our method combines myocardial segment\ndisplacement features from multiple segmentation models, which are then input\ninto a typical classifier to estimate the risk of MI.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of asynchronous\ndecentralized federated lifelong learning (ADFLL) method that inherits the\nmerits of federated learning and can train on multiple tasks simultaneously\nwithout the need for a central node or synchronous training. Thus, overcoming\nthe potential drawbacks of conventional federated learning.

To this\nend, we propose optimizing user retention with Decision Transformer~(DT), which\navoids the offline difficulty by translating the RL as an autoregressive\nproblem. However, deploying the DT in recommendation is a non-trivial problem\nbecause of the following challenges: (1) deficiency in modeling the numerical\nreward value; (2) data discrepancy between the policy learning and\nrecommendation generation; (3) unreliable offline performance evaluation. In\nthis work, we, therefore, contribute a series of strategies for tackling the\nexposed issues. We first articulate an efficient reward prompt by weighted\naggregation of meta embeddings for informative reward embedding. Then, we endow\na weighted contrastive learning method to solve the discrepancy between\ntraining and inference. Furthermore, we design two robust offline metrics to\nmeasure user retention. Finally, the significant improvement in the benchmark\ndatasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.\n","authors":["Kesen Zhao","Lixin Zou","Xiangyu Zhao","Maolin Wang","Dawei yin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06347v1.pdf","comment":"9 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06337v1","updated":"2023-03-11T07:50:49Z","published":"2023-03-11T07:50:49Z","title":"AutoMLP: Automated MLP for Sequential Recommendations","summary":"  Sequential recommender systems aim to predict users' next interested item\ngiven their historical interactions. However, a long-standing issue is how to\ndistinguish between users' long/short-term interests, which may be\nheterogeneous and contribute differently to the next recommendation. Existing\napproaches usually set pre-defined short-term interest length by exhaustive\nsearch or empirical experience, which is either highly inefficient or yields\nsubpar results. The recent advanced transformer-based models can achieve\nstate-of-the-art performances despite the aforementioned issue, but they have a\nquadratic computational complexity to the length of the input sequence. To this\nend, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming\nfor better modeling users' long/short-term interests from their historical\ninteractions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm\nfor preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization.

Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and\nupscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR\nvia invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social\nmedia), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will\nlead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse\nupscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware\nimage rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an\nend-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for\nhigh-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical\nanalysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information\n(including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and\npropose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR\nimages in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize\nthe learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling\ndatasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under\nstandard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).\n","authors":["Jinhai Yang","Mengxi Guo","Shijie Zhao","Junlin Li","Li Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02353v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by AAAI 2023.

However, recent studies show\nthat the imbalanced optimization of uni-modal encoders in a joint-learning\nmodel is a bottleneck to enhancing the model's performance. We further find\nthat the up-to-date imbalance-mitigating methods fail on some audio-visual\nfine-grained tasks, which have a higher demand for distinguishable feature\ndistribution. Fueled by the success of cosine loss that builds hyperspherical\nfeature spaces and achieves lower intra-class angular variability, this paper\nproposes Multi-Modal Cosine loss, MMCosine. It performs a modality-wise $L_2$\nnormalization to features and weights towards balanced and better multi-modal\nfine-grained learning. We demonstrate that our method can alleviate the\nimbalanced optimization from the perspective of weight norm and fully exploit\nthe discriminability of the cosine metric.

Existing methods adopt a predictive coding architecture, which\nrequires joint encoding to compress the corresponding disparity as well as\nresidual information. This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the\nepipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it\nchallenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly\noverlapping fields of view.
